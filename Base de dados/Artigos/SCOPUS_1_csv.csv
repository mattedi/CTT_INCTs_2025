Despite this importance, much of Brazil's marine biodiversity remains poorly mapped and quantified. Therefore, the National Institute of Science and Technology for the Blue Amazon Biodiversity (INCT-BAA) was established to expand knowledge on this region. One of INCT-BAA's primary objectives is to develop an integrated database that combines historical and contemporary information on marine biodiversity. To support this objective, a state-of-the-art systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize existing knowledge on species occurrence, spatial and temporal distribution, natural and anthropogenic threats, ecological scope of studies, and knowledge gaps and trends. Given the broad scope of the review, a specific protocol was developed, requiring adaptations to traditional systematic review methodologies (e.g., elaboration of a robust glossary of categories and methods to extract species locations from papers), which are detailed in this document. The review was conducted over one year using 1,034 search strings across Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar and retrieving over 200,000 species occurrences from 7,687 studies, covering more than 27,000 species from 1917 to 2023. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Revista USP, (2017); Glamann, Josefine, The intersection of food security and biodiversity conservation: a review, Regional Environmental Change, 17, 5, pp. 1303-1313, (2017); Wilke, D.

The host factors associated with disease pathogenesis have nonetheless remained obscure, and little is known about the immune determinants of protection against OROV. Methods: We tracked morbidity, mortality, viral loads, and serum neutralisation in wild-type (WT), Rag1−/−, CD19-Cre+ Ifnarfl, and CD19-Cre+ MyD88fl mice and performed immunophenotyping experiments, passive serum transfers, and adoptive cell transfers to determine how early antibody responses and B cell subsets control viral replication and dissemination to the central nervous system after infection with OROV. Findings: In line with a protective role for B cells, WT mice efficiently produced OROV-specific antibodies within 6 days of infection. Serum transfer containing neutralising IgM from WT to Rag1−/− mice prevented neurological disease in OROV-challenged mice. CD19-Cre+ MyD88fl mice but not CD19-Cre+ Ifnarfl mice were vulnerable to neurological disease and produced lower titres of OROV-specific antibodies that exhibited suboptimal neutralisation and potency compared with MyD88-sufficient mice. CD19-Cre+ MyD88fl mice also presented with reduced numbers of marginal zone B (MZB) cells and plasmablasts after infection, which were associated with high viral burdens and lethality. Adoptive transfer of MZB cells from WT mice protected CD19-Cre+ MyD88fl mice and partially protected Rag1−/− mice from lethal infection with OROV. Interpretation: Early MyD88 signalling in B cells is required for optimal antibody responses that limit viral replication and neurological disease in mice infected with OROV.

Recently, a new class of antidiabetic agents–the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors–was associated with a significant reduction on mortality and hospitalization in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) when added to standard pharmacological treatment. Considering the lack of data on its cost-effectiveness, the present study aims to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of add-on dapagliflozin treatment for HFrEF from the Brazilian public healthcare system perspective. Methods: We built a Markov model to estimate the clinical outcomes and costs of 1,000 hypothetical subjects with established HFrEF in a lifetime horizon. The model inputs were based on the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) trial and local data. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, as well as scenario analyses, were performed. Findings: The addition of dapagliflozin to standard care treatment in 1,000 HFrEF patients yielded an expected value of 366.99 additional QALYs at an incremental cost of US$ 1,517,878.49, resulting in an ICER of US$ 4,136.08 per QALY gained, being a cost-effective strategy considering the Brazilian official cost-effectiveness threshold (US$ 8,000/QALY). In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, 96.60% of the simulations were also cost-effective. In the scenario analyses, results were similar for individuals with and without diabetes. Interpretation: Dapagliflozin is likely to be cost-effective when added to standard HFrEF therapy in Brazil.

In 2024, an epidemic of Oropouche fever spread in Brazil, with more than 7930 cases reported between Jan 1 and Aug 31. Infections in pregnant people have suggested the possibility of negative fetal consequences, therefore we tested newborns with microcephaly for known congenital pathogens and Oropouche virus (OROV). Methods: In this case series, we assessed historical cases of infants born with microcephaly, arthrogryposis, and other congenital malformations without a confirmed cause and their mothers for potential OROV congenital infections. The study population consisted of infants born in Brazil with samples from 2015–21 and 2024. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from this case series were analysed for: syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, HIV, Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Individuals that were negative for these pathogens were then tested for OROV. Pathogen testing included ELISA and haemagglutination inhibition testing for antibodies and RT-PCR for virus RNA. Findings: We tested 68 samples from 65 historical cases of congential malformations and three cases from 2024. All cases were from ten states in Brazil. Three historical cases tested positive for OROV and 62 historical cases tested negative. The three cases from 2024 all tested positive for OROV. Of the positive cases, five were female and one was male. Not all pathogens were tested for each case, and some did not have maternal samples available. One of the newborns (case 6) died aged 47 days and tissue samples were tested by real-time RT-PCR, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry assays. One other newborn died in 2016 but no post-mortem samples were available. OROV IgM was detected in five of five newborn CSF samples, and five of five newborn serum samples. Four of five maternal serum samples were positive for OROV IgM. One of four newborn CSF samples (case 6 at age 44 days) was OROV positive by real-time RT-quantitative PCR and 0 of four newborn serum samples were positive, as were 0 of three maternal serum samples. Case 6 had major tissue changes of the brain macroscopically and microscopically, including necrotic and apoptotic changes of neurons, microglia and astrocytes, vacuolisation, and tissue atrophy. OROV RNA was detected in brain, lungs, kidney, CSF, and pleural fluid; OROV antigens were found in CNS, liver, kidney, heart, and lung, mainly in neurons and microglia and also in endothelial cells, suggesting vasculitis. Interpretation: We detected OROV IgM in six of 68 newborns with microcephaly of unknown cause. One infant who died had OROV RNA and antigen in several tissues, including the brain. The possibility of OROV vertical transmission and potential fetal harm must be investigated with urgency. The evidence presented here does not completely confirm vertical transmission or congenital malformations due to OROV, but thorough case finding and detailed investigation of maternal or fetal OROV infection is a priority.

The identification of this multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen outside the hospital setting has become increasingly frequent, and raises an alert for the global health agencies, as they indicate a possible spread of such pathogens. Herein, we described three MDR P. rettgeri isolates carrying a diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) isolated from stool samples of swine and bovine in Brazil. Molecular analysis revealed that all isolates belonged to the same clone. The whole genome sequencing (WGS) of a representative isolate (PVR-188) was performed by MiSeq Illumina® platform, while the assembling and annotation was achieved using SPAdes and Prooka, respectively. The WGS analyses indicated the presence of ARGs that confer resistance to β-lactams (bla<inf>NDM-1</inf>, bla<inf>CTX-M-2</inf>), quinolones (qnrD1), aminoglycosides (aadA2, aadA1, aph(3′)-Via), phenicol (catB2), sulfonamides (sul1, sul2), and trimethoprim (dfrA12, dfrA1). The presence of three plasmid replicons (Col3M, IncQ1, and IncT) was detected, but no phage sequences were found. The phylogenetic analyses confirmed the genomic relationship of the PVR-188 with P. rettgeri isolates recovered from animals and humans in the USA and Malaysia. In conclusion, we report the occurrence of MDR P. rettgeri clone colonizing the gut microbiota of food-producing animals in Brazil, revealing the spread of this pathogen beyond hospital boundaries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abdallah, Mohammad, First literature review of carbapenem-resistant Providencia, New Microbes and New Infections, 25, pp. 16-23, (2018); Sharma, Deepak Kumar, First case report of Providencia Rettgeri neonatal sepsis, BMC Research Notes, 10, 1, (2017); Lee, GilHo, Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis with nephrocutaneous fistula due to Providencia rettgeri infection, Journal of Medical Microbiology, 60, 7, pp. 1050-1052, (2011); McGann, Patrick TMc, Pan-drug resistant Providencia rettgeri contributing to a fatal case of COVID-19, Journal of Medical Microbiology, 70, 8, (2021); Yoh, Myonsun, Importance of Providencia species as a major cause of travellers' diarrhoea, Journal of Medical Microbiology, 54, 11, pp. 1077-1082, (2005); Washington, Michael A., A Case of Wound Infection with Providencia rettgeri and Coincident Gout in a Patient from Guam, Hawai'i journal of medicine & public health : a journal of Asia Pacific Medicine & Public Health, 74, 11, pp. 375-377, (2015); Koreishi, Aaleya F., Ocular Infections Caused by Providencia rettgeri, Ophthalmology, 113, 8, pp. 1463-1466, (2006); Ntshobeni, Noyise B., Draft genome sequence of providencia rettgeri apw139_s1, an ndm-18-producing clinical strain originating from hospital effluent in South Africa, Microbiology Resource Announcements, 8, 21, (2019); Shin, Saeam, Emergence of multidrug-resistant Providencia rettgeri isolates co-producing NDM-1 carbapenemase and PER-1 extended-spectrum β-lactamase causing a first outbreak in Korea, Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials, 17, 1, (2018); Márquez-Ortiz, Ricaurte Alejandro, First complete Providencia rettgeri genome sequence, the NDM-1-producing clinical strain RB151, Genome Announcements, 5, 3, (2017)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203956770"

Brazil is a large country with diverse multicultural and ethnic heritages and important socioeconomic inequalities. The burden of liver disease in Brazil, its regions and population is unknown. Methods: We retrieved data from the Unified Health System regarding liver diseases and analyzed the mortality and morbidity from 1996 to 2022 by gender, race/ethnicity, age, region and overall. We calculated the age-specific risk of deaths by liver disease, age-standardization of the data, mean hospitalization and liver transplant-associated costs. Findings: Malignant neoplasm of the liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, alcohol-associated liver disease, fibrosis, and cirrhosis of the liver, other diseases of the liver, hepatic failure, chronic viral hepatitis were identified as the major causes of death and morbidity in Brazil in the period analyzed. The epidemiology of these diseases was diverse, with variations according to geographic regions, gender and race/ethnicity. The major economic burden of liver disease is related to liver transplants, a common outcome of the progression of these diseases. Interpretation: Liver disease in Brazil is a serious issue for the public health system due to the high number of deaths and increasing mortality rate. Our study contributes as a necessary prerequisite for the development of tailored public health policies aimed at mitigating the increasing burden of liver diseases in specific populations and regions.

The incorporation of social cartography as a methodological instrument in the research allowed the identification of attributes in the study area, organised using two approaches: “Analytic Hierarchy Process"" (AHP) and Nexus+ (food, water, energy and socio-ecological security). Through these, it was possible to delimit the study area into agro-villages and identify more than 720 attributes or reference points, ranging from human activities to local infrastructure. The attributes were identified through action research techniques, participatory observation and collaborative research, using geographic information applications and satellite images. It was possible to generate relevant information about the study area in terms of potential, infrastructure, crops, and production, in addition to generating maps of the vulnerability situation linked to Nexus+ security (energy and water), which should be replicated since it allows highlighting the social, economic, environmental and infrastructure characteristics of a given area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cartografias Sociais E Territorio, (2008); Povos E Comunidades Tradicionais, (2013); Araújo Filho, Moacyr Cunha De, The socio-ecological Nexus+ approach used by the Brazilian Research Network on Global Climate Change, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 39, pp. 62-70, (2019); A Etnocartografia no Brasil 10 Anos Depois Equipe De Conservacao Da Amazonia Act Brasil, (2011); de Kássia Rocha Bargas, Janine, Social cartography and political organization among remaining quilombos communities from Salvaterra, Marajó, Pará, Brazil, Boletim do Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi: Ciencias Humanas, 10, 2, pp. 469-488, (2015); El Cuerpo Como Territorio De La Rebeldia, (2006); Chapin, Mac, Mapping indigenous lands, Annual Review of Anthropology, 34, pp. 619-638, (2005); Projeto Publico De Irrigacao Jacare Curituba; Dalton, Craig M., Counter-mapping data science, Canadian Geographies/Geographies Canadiennes, 62, 1, pp. 93-101, (2018); J Cartografia Social Teoria Y Metodo Estrategias Para Una Eficaz Transformacion Comunitaria, (2018)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212939688"

The inventory included monthly field collections (2014–2015, 2017–2018) in a PPBio Program RAPELD module, searches in the INCT - Virtual Herbarium and literature, followed by a careful taxonomic review, including avascular and vascular plants. Species were assigned to a category for their habitats, habits, life forms, origin, extinction risk status, and substrate type. Overall, 992 species were registered (515 genera, 140 families). The Angiosperms comprised 887 species (110 families), of which 65% were woody species: 370 (41.7%) trees, six palm trees (0.7%), 146 (16.5%) shrubs, 56 (6.3%) climbers; and 309 (35%) were herbaceous plants. The most important angiosperm families were Fabaceae (90 species), Poaceae (54 spp.), Rubiaceae (47 spp.), Myrtaceae (35 spp.), Cyperaceae and Melastomataceae (32 spp. each). Forty-four species of ferns and lycophytes (15 families) were recorded; Pteridaceae (12 spp.), Thelypteridaceae (6 spp.), and Polypodiaceae (5 spp.) were the richest. We registered 61 species (14 families) of avascular plants, of which Lejeuneaceae (23 spp.), Calymperaceae (9 spp.) and Sematophyllaceae (7 spp.) exhibited the highest richness. We found 13 threatened species, such as Canistrum aurantiacum (Bromeliaceae) and Ocotea odorifera (Lauraceae). Our results confirm that the PEDI holds a high floristic richness in comparison to other checklists from this Atlantic Forest region. This highlights the importance of the Dois Irmãos State Park as a unique and valuable natural resource, and the need for more conservation efforts to protect this area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abreu, Rodolfo C.R., Exotic tree Artocarpus heterophyllus (Moraceae) invades the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, Rodriguesia, 61, 4, pp. 677-688, (2010); Agra, Maria De Fátima, Flora of paraíba, Brazil: Solanum L.

The maps are made using an innovative pre-processing and interpolation scheme. The system is already implemented and tested, being composed of a single real-time server with a database and modules that perform reception from the GNSS stations, data processing, and the online dissemination. All these tasks are executed asynchronously in a pipeline manner using the database as a central hub without any loss of data. The challenges that must be overcome to have real-time capability were: (i) to configure GNSS stations to send S4 data to a real-time server able to (ii) receive S4 data from the GNSS stations, (iii) generate sequences of S4 scintillation maps, and (iv) make these maps available in a web server. The implemented system was able to acquire data from all available stations of the monitoring networks, being robust concerning interruption of connections or different processing times of the tasks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bandyopadhayay, T., Degradation of navigational accuracy with global positioning system during periods of scintillation at equatorial latitudes, Electronics Letters, 33, 12, pp. 1010-1011, (1997); GPS Scinda A Real Time GPS Data Acquisition and Ionospheric Analysis System for Scinda, (2007); de Paula, Eurico Rodrigues, Characteristics of the ionospheric F-region plasma irregularities over brazilian longitudinal sector, Indian Journal of Radio and Space Physics, 36, 4, pp. 268-277, (2007); de Paula, Eurico Rodrigues, Performance of 6 Different Global Navigation Satellite System Receivers at Low Latitude Under Moderate and Strong Scintillation, Earth and Space Science, 8, 2, (2021); de Paula, Eurico Rodrigues, A Retrospective of Global Navigation Satellite System Ionospheric Irregularities Monitoring Networks in Brazil, Journal of Aerospace Technology and Management, 15, (2023); de Rezende, Luiz Felipe Campos, Mapping and survey of plasma bubbles over Brazilian territory, Journal of Navigation, 60, 1, pp. 69-81, (2007); Humphreys, Todd E., Analysis of ionospheric scintillations using wideband GPS L1 C/A signal data, pp. 399-407, (2004); Kintner, Paul M.S., Fading timescales associated with GPS signals and potential consequences, Radio Science, 36, 4, pp. 731-743, (2001); Kintner, Paul M.S., An amplitude scintillation test pattern standard for evaluating GPS receiver performance, Space Weather, 2, 3, pp. 13-18, (2005); Leick, Alfred, GPS satellite surveying, (1990)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196490325"

It is therefore important to carry out surveys and mapping to make knowledge more accessible. In this context, the aim of this work was to organize and discuss the information and data related to the fungi of Raso da Catarina, cataloguing and presenting the first checklist of Ascomycota in an insufficiently researched locality, adding knowledge from scientific collections, publications, and field expeditions. Method: Literature searches were carried out on the Ascomycota of the Raso da Catarina Ecoregion; consultations of the Fungal Databases, U.S. National Fungus Collections, the EMBRAPA database (Fungi Reported on Plants in Brazil) and the Mycology Collections Portal; consultations of the speciesLink networks that integrate data from scientific collections; consultations of the Reflora Virtual Herbarium and the INCT-Herbário Virtual da Flora e dos Fungos. In addition to field expeditions in areas of the Raso da Catarina in the municipalities of Paulo Afonso, Jeremoabo and Glória. Results and conclusion: A total of 243 taxa comprising 75 asexual fungi, 85 lichenized sexual fungi and 73 non-lichenized sexual fungi, distributed in 148 genera, were catalogued. This work represents an initiative to systematize research carried out in Raso da Catarina, with the aim of adding knowledge to the estimate of Ascomycota species in the Caatinga. Originality/value: Work on fungi in areas of the Raso da Catarina is still incipient. Some data is scattered in a few publications and many taxa are in scientific collections without being published. This is therefore the first checklist of Ascomycota for the Ecoregion and provides relevant information. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amorim, Vívian Oliveira, Asteraceae from the Ecoregion Raso da Catarina, Bahia, Brazil, Rodriguesia, 67, 3, pp. 785-794, (2016); Agrotropica, (2019); da Cruz, Alisson Cardoso Rodrigues, Conidial fungi from Caatinga: Leaf litter species, Acta Botanica Brasilica, 23, 4, pp. 999-1012, (2009); da Cruz, Alisson Cardoso Rodrigues, Conidial fungi from Caatinga: Lignicolous species, Acta Botanica Brasilica, 23, 4, pp. 1133-1144, (2009); Cruz, Alisson Cardoso Rodrigues D.A., Conidial fungi from the semi-arid Caatinga biome of Brazil.

Accordingly, we propose an alternative scheme of the finite difference method implemented in two coordinate systems, where the initial conditions are placed on the axis of the tortoise coordinate with appropriate boundary conditions that fully respect the causality. The scheme is then employed to study the temporal profiles of the quasinormal oscillations in the Schwarzschild black hole and uniform-density stars. When presented as a two-dimensional evolution profile, the resulting ringdown waveforms in the black hole metric are split into reflected and transmitted waves as the initial perturbations evolve and collide with the peak of the effective potential. Meanwhile, for compact stars, quasinormal oscillations might be characterized by echoes. Consistent with the causality arguments, the phenomenon is produced by the gravitational waves bouncing between the divergent potential at the star's center and the peak of the effective potential.

The book is divided into four parts. The first part presents the theoretical framework and the historical context in which the teaching program was developed by the group led by Drs. Julio Cesar de Rose and Deisy das Gra de Souza, currently organized in the National Institute of Science and Technology on Behavior, Cognition, and Learning (INCT/ECCE). The second part describes the modules that make up the Learning to Read and Write in Small Steps teaching program. The third part presents results of empirical research conducted with children with intellectual and hearing disabilities and illiterate adults. Finally, the fourth part presents contributions from other areas of knowledge such as speech therapy, linguistics, and education to the understanding of reading and writing and possible dialogues between them and behavior analysis. Contributions of Behavior Analysis to Reading and Writing Comprehension will be of interest to researchers and students in the fields of psychology and education interested in the application of behavior analysis to teaching and learning processes. It will also be a valuable resource for professionals directly working in educational institutions, such as elementary school teachers and psycho-pedagogues.

In this region, the occurrence of phenomena such as ionospheric scintillation can affect the availability of satellites used for positioning. GBAS uses pseudorange smoothed measurements, which the filter must be restarted whenever satellite measurements are affected by ionospheric scintillation. Using a filter with a smoothing time constant of 100 s, a satellite could go up to 6 min without contributing to the positioning solution. In a scenario of strong ionospheric scintillation, in which many satellites can be affected, this can make the use of GBAS unfeasible for some time. Therefore, in this study, we evaluate the performance of GBAS in scenarios where the smoothing time constant is reduced under conditions of ionospheric scintillation. The processing used data from three days (DOYs 072 to 074/2023) with the occurrence of ionospheric scintillation, at 4 GNSS stations of the INCT GNSS NavAer Network located in Presidente Prudente (Brazil). Of these, three stations were defined as reference stations, and the fourth station was defined as an aircraft in the static mode. Processing was performed using the PEGASUS software developed by EUROCONTROL in GAST C and D modes for smoothing time constants of 0, 10, 30, and 100 s. The results showed that the solution without pseudorange smoothing (0 s) generated the highest number of GBAS positioning solutions. However, in terms of quality, these unsmoothed solutions were noisier compared to those with other smoothing time constants. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","de Oliveira Nascimento Brassarote, Gabriela, S4index: Does it only measure ionospheric scintillation?, GPS Solutions, 22, 1, (2018); Eurocontrol Pegasus Tool; Jiang, Yiping, Code carrier divergence monitoring for dual-frequency GBAS, GPS Solutions, 21, 2, pp. 769-781, (2017); Monico, João Francisco Galera, The GNSS NavAer INCT Project Overview and Main Results, Journal of Aerospace Technology and Management, 14, (2022); Stuani Pereira, Vinícius Amadeu, Brazilian active GNSS networks as systems for monitoring the ionosphere, GPS Solutions, 21, 3, pp. 1013-1025, (2017); Pullen, Sam P., Ground Based Augmentation Systems, Springer Handbooks, pp. 905-932, (2017); Rotondo, G., Methodology for determining pseudorange noise and multipath models for a multi-constellation, multi-frequency GBAS system, pp. 383-392, (2015); Minimum Operational Performance Standards for GPS Local Area Augmentation System Airborne Equipment, (2008); Minimum Operational Performance Standards for GPS Local Area Augmentation System Airborne Equipment, (2017); Vani, Bruno César, Visual exploration and analysis of ionospheric scintillation monitoring data: The ISMR Query Tool, Computers and Geosciences, 104, pp. 125-134, (2017)","Conference paper","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184563361"

For cancer patients, poor accessibility has been associated with inadequate treatment, worse prognosis, and poorer quality of life. Methods: We explored nationwide healthcare data from the SUS health information systems, and mapped the geographic accessibility to cancer treatment in two time-frames: 2009–2010 and 2017–2018. We applied social network analysis (SNA) to estimate the commuting route, flow, and distances travelled by cancer patients to undergo surgical, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy treatment. Findings: A total of 12,751,728 treatment procedures were analyzed. Overall, more than half of the patients (49·2 to 60·7%) needed to travel beyond their municipality of residence for treatment, a fact that did not change over time. Marked regional differences were observed, as patients living in the northern and midwestern regions of the country had to travel longer distances (weighted average of 296 to 870 km). Cancer care hubs and attraction poles were mostly identified in the southeast and northeast regions, with Barretos being the main hub for all types of treatment throughout time. Interpretation: Important regional disparities in the accessibility to cancer treatment in Brazil were revealed, suggesting the need to review the distribution of specialized care in the country. The data presented here contribute to ongoing research on improving access to cancer care and can provide reference to other countries, offering relevant data for oncological and healthcare service evaluation, monitoring, and strategic planning. Funding: This work was funded by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation - Fiocruz (Inova - no. 8451635123 to BPF) and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq (no. 407060/2018–9 to BPF); Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel – CAPES (scholarship to PCA, Finance Code 001); and Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia de Inovação em Doenças de Populações Negligenciadas (INCT-IDPN). Resumo: A acessibilidade geográfica aos serviços de saúde é um componente fundamental para o alcance da cobertura universal de saúde, compromisso central do Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS). Para pacientes com câncer, a baixa acessibilidade aos serviços especializados tem sido associada ao tratamento inadequado, piora no prognóstico e na qualidade de vida. Neste estudo, dados de saúde dos sistemas de informação em saúde do SUS foram utilizados para mapear a acessibilidade geográfica ao tratamento do câncer em dois períodos: 2009–2010 e 2017–2018. Aplicamos a análise de redes sociais (ARS) para estimar os fluxos de deslocamento e as distâncias percorridas por pacientes com câncer para receberem tratamento cirúrgico, radioterápico e quimioterápico. Um total de 12.751.728 procedimentos de tratamento foram analisados. Em geral, mais da metade dos pacientes (49,2 a 60,7%) precisaram se deslocar de seus municípios de residência para receber tratamento, fato que não mudou comparando os dois períodos de tempo analisados. Foram observadas importantes diferenças regionais no acesso. Pacientes residentes das regiões norte e centro-oeste do país tiveram que percorrer maiores distâncias para alcançar os serviços (média ponderada = 296 a 870 km). A maioria dos hubs e polos de atração para atendimento oncológico foram identificados nas regiões Sudeste e Nordeste, sendo o município de Barretos o principal hub para todos os tipos de tratamento ao longo do tempo. As disparidades de acessibilidade para o tratamento de câncer, alertam para a necessidade de revisar a distribuição dos serviços de atenção especializada no país. A metodologia e os resultados apresentados neste estudo contribuem para as pesquisas sobre a melhoria do acesso ao tratamento do câncer e podem servir como referência para outros países, oferecendo dados relevantes para avaliação, monitoramento e planejamento estratégico de serviços oncológicos e de saúde em geral. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, (2025); Lévesque, Jean Frédéric, Patient-centred access to health care: Conceptualising access at the interface of health systems and populations, International Journal for Equity in Health, 12, 1, (2013); Aspects of Medical Care Administration Specifying Requirements for Health Care, (1973); Penchansky, Roy, The concept of access: Definition and relationship to consumer satisfaction, Medical Care, 19, 2, pp. 127-140, (1981); Omrani-Khoo, Habib, Equity in distribution of health care resources; assessment of need and access, using three practical indicators, Iranian Journal of Public Health, 42, 11, pp. 1299-1308, (2013); Rosero-Bixby, Luis R., Spatial access to health care in Costa Rica and its equity: A GIS-based study, Social Science and Medicine, 58, 7, pp. 1271-1284, (2004); Apparicio, Philippe, Comparing alternative approaches to measuring the geographical accessibility of urban health services: Distance types and aggregation-error issues, International Journal of Health Geographics, 7, (2008); Peters, David H., Poverty and access to health care in developing countries, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1136, pp. 161-171, (2008); Hierink, Fleur, The winding road to health: A systematic scoping review on the effect of geographical accessibility to health care on infectious diseases in low- And middle-income countries, PLOS ONE, 16, 1 January, (2021); Ambroggi, Massimo, Distance as a barrier to cancer diagnosis and treatment: Review of the literature, Oncologist, 20, 12, pp. 1378-1385, (2015)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126929560"

It allows the determination of the aircraft’s position in all phases of the flight and brings many advantages. Although GNSS navigation results in gains, the radio signals from these systems are strongly influenced by the ionospheric environment. It introduces errors that can affect the accuracy, integrity, availability and continuity requirements established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The ionospheric layer has different behaviors depending on the latitude, time of day, season of the year, geomagnetic activity and solar cycle. Since Brazil is located in a region of low latitudes, it experiences a series of unique challenges when compared to regions of mid-latitudes. For this reason, the application of GNSS-based technologies in aviation over the Brazilian territory requires an in-depth assessment of the ionosphere effects. Therefore, the Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia (INCT) named GNSS Technology for Supporting Air Navigation was formed in 2017 to better assess the ionosphere impacts and assist government agencies and companies in the development of safe air navigation procedures over Brazil in a near future.

The test conditions and sample matrix were finalized during fall 2017 and the tests have been performed during the next 14 months. Two fundamental experimental tests related to normal operating conditions and accidental conditions of LWRs were defined: High-temperature steam oxidation and Long-term corrosion tests. Originally, four laboratories/institutes joined the round robin exercise - CTU in Prague, KIT, VTT, and INCT. Later, also MTA EK joined the activity. Zircaloy-2 substrate was provided by Westinghouse Electric Company and two institutes applied their protective coatings on its surface (CTU - pure Cr coating and INCT - ZrSi-Cr coating). KIT applied MAX phase coating on Zircaloy-4 substrate. Additionally, AISI 348 steel provided by USP, Brazil was tested. The geometry of the samples varied based on the needs of particular institutes. Long-term corrosion tests were performed by three laboratories in PWR and VVER chemistry for at least 63 cumulative days. High-temperature steam oxidation tests were performed by four institutes at three pre-defined conditions. Participants performed pre- and post-characterization of the material based on their standard procedures and available techniques. The paper summarizes motivation, plans, sample matrix, materials, testing conditions and preliminary results including lessons learnt.

SUMMARY ANSWER: The eutopic endometrium of infertile women with endometriosis seems to be transcriptionally similar to the endometrium of infertile and fertile controls (FC) during the IW. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Endometriosis is a disease related to infertility; nevertheless, little is known regarding the ethiopathogenic mechanisms underlying this association. Some studies evaluating the eutopic endometrium of endometriosis patients suggest there is an endometrial factor involved in the disease-related infertility. However, no study to date has evaluated the endometrial transcriptome (mRNA and miRNA) by next generation sequencing (NGS), comparing patients with endometriosis as the exclusive infertility factor (END) to infertile controls (IC; male and/or tubal factor) and FC. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: From November 2011 to November 2015 we performed a case-control study, where 17 endometrial samples (six END, six IC, five FC) were collected during the IW. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All endometrial samples had the RNA extracted. Two libraries were prepared for each one (mRNA and miRNA), which were sequenced, respectively, at HISEQ 2500 (RNA-Seq) and MiSeq System (miRNA-Seq), Illumina. The normalization and differential expression were conducted in statistical R environment using DESeq2 package. qPCR was used for data validation, which were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn posttest (P < 0.05). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: RNA-Seq revealed no differentially expressed genes (DEG) among END, IC and FC groups. miRNA-Seq revealed three differentially expressed miRNAs (has-27a-5p, has-miR-150-5p, has-miR-504-5p) in END group compared to FC group. However, none of the miRNAs identified in the sequencing was validated by qPCR. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The main limitation of this study was the small sample size evaluated as a result of the restrictive eligibility criteria adopted, limiting the generalization of the results obtained here. On the other hand, strict eligibility criteria, which eliminated factors potentially related to impaired endometrial receptivity, were required to increase the study's internal validity. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study brings new perspectives on the mechanisms involved in endometriosis-related infertility. The present findings suggest the eutopic endometrium of infertile women with endometriosis, without considering the disease's stage, is transcriptionally similar to controls during the IW, possibly not affecting receptivity. Further studies are needed to evaluate endometrial alterations related to endometriosis' stages. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study received financial support from the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP - Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo; fellowship 2011/17614-6, MGB) and from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq - Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico; INCT - National Institutes of Hormones and Woman's Health, grant 471 943/2012-6, 309 397/2016-2, PAN; fellowship 140 137/2015-7, MGB).

They are usually elaborated, launched and managed by research funding agencies. In order to select the most adequate research projects, agencies often rely on the peer review process. This paper introduces a methodology to support funding decisions based on the peer review process. The methodology involves the use of a multicriteria decision model to support the assessment, evaluation, prioritization and selection of applications, under a multi-step decision-making process, which fits into a strategic management cycle within the agency. The Multiattribute Value Theory, being considered under a Value Focused Thinking approach, provides a basis for the construction of the multicriteria decision model. The good practices in peer review and also a logical framework for program management are considered by the methodology. A pilot study, presented in the paper, involved a retrospective implementation of a peer review process in the context of a program launched by the Ministry for Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications and the National Council of Technological and Scientific Development, in Brazil. The methodology allowed a clear distinction of roles. The agency staff in the role of decision-makers was responsible for making value judgments on behalf of the agency. The experts, in the role of committee members and ad hoc reviewers, contributed with their expertise by providing objective assessments. Such assessments served as a basis for evaluating the applications, characterizing the possible portfolios, and can be considered as data in future program evaluation studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abdoul, Hendy, Peer Review of Grant Applications: Criteria Used and Qualitative Study of Reviewer Practices, PLOS ONE, 7, 9, (2012); Abramo, Giovanni, Evaluating research: From informed peer review to bibliometrics, Scientometrics, 87, 3, pp. 499-514, (2011); Abramo, Giovanni, Allocative efficiency in public research funding: Can bibliometrics help?, Research Policy, 38, 1, pp. 206-215, (2009); Strengthening the Standards Recommendations for Oeri Peer Review, (1999); Value Functions for Environmental Management, (1997); Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis an Integrated Approach, (2002); Bornmann, Lutz, What is societal impact of research and how can it be assessed? a literature survey, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 64, 2, pp. 217-233, (2013); Borrás, Susana, The choice of innovation policy instruments, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 80, 8, pp. 1513-1522, (2013); Calders, Toon, PROMETHEE is not quadratic: An O(qnlog(n)) algorithm, Omega (United Kingdom), 76, pp. 63-69, (2018); Choo, Engung, Interpretation of criteria weights in multicriteria decision making, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 37, 3, pp. 527-541, (1999)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050606966"

Unfortunately, the derivatives of the condensates with respect to the magnetic-field φ'f, which do not contribute due the extremization conditions ( ∂ Ω /∂φf=0), were mistakenly considered in Eq. (3.4) therein. Once this mistake is corrected the relation for the magnetization reads (Formula Presented) where θ'magf and θ'medf are presented in Eqs. (A2) and (A4), respectively, of the Appendix in the original paper. Therefore, only the kinetic term of the thermodynamical potential contributes to the magnetization. This expression is consistent with the one previously obtained in Ref. [1]. Using Eq. (1)we next reobtain the magnetization as well as the pressure which are shown in Figs. 1 and 2respectively, for the same cases presented in Figs. 2 and 3 of the original paper and draw some conclusions. (Figure Presented) We first comment on Fig. 1. Contrary to our previous findings, once the correct expression for the magnetization Eq. (1) is considered, one observes that the magnetization presents much smaller oscillations than the ones found in the original paper. Besides, the average magnetization increases with the increase in the magnetic field. The results are now very similar to the ones obtained in Ref. [2]for strange quark matter and in Ref. [3] for a gas of protons when the anomalous magnetic moment is not included. The magnetization is essentially positive for fields B>5×1017G, but below that field it may get negative values in some restricted density regions (never lower than -0.002fm-2). It remains possible to identify the superposition of the contributions from the different quarks, which due to their differences in mass and charge, give rise to the irregular oscillations of the magnetization. However, the onset of the strange quark does not produce the strong effects previously calculated, which was due to the derivative of the condensate, in particular, Eq. (A7) of the original paper. The new results presented in Fig. 2 are also very much in line with the findings of Refs. [2,4,5], however different from the ones of Ref. [1]. For fields of B≤1018G the perpendicular pressure falls on top of the parallel contribution. P⊥ differs from P? only above B>1018G, and the discontinuities present in the previous version are no longer present. As a concluding remark, we say that the anisotropic effects on the kinetic pressure are only noticeable for magnetic fields larger than 4×1018Gas already pointed out in Ref. [5]. Note that the anisotropies discussed in the present Erratum and associated with the quantities denominated as parallel and perpendicular pressures correspond to the space elements of the energy-momentum tensor diagonal. On the other hand, the matter pressure, a thermodynamic quantity obtained from the derivative of the partition function, is a scalar, and its value is independent of the direction considered, see, for instance, Refs. [6-8] for discussions. D.P.M. and M.B.P. were partially supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnológico (CNPq-Brazil) and by Project INCT-FNA Project No. 464898/2014-5.

The sugarcane cell wall structure and architecture is now better understood, dozens of new cell wall hydrolases had their genes and enzymes fully characterized, sugargane physiology and its responses to climate change were investigated, and novel yeast strains capable to metabolize pentoses have been discovered. At the same time, history and politics involved in sugarcane as a bioenergy source have been studied and revised. Thus, simultaneously with other large bioenergy programs in the USA and Europe that were set up to improve renewable energy production, the INCT-Bioetanol in Brazil managed to produce important data in basic research.

It reports achievements that have been advancing the science of cell walls, enzymes, genetics, and sustainability related to sugarcane technologies and give continuity to the research reported in the “Routes to Cellulosic Ethanol”, from Springer. The Introduction (Chapter I) explains how the National Institute of Science and Technology of Bioethanol, founded in 2008 in Brazil, became part of the main international initiatives that started to search for forms to use biomass for bioethanol production in Brazil, US and Europe. Part I reports the advances in plant cell wall composition, structure and architecture, and physical characteristics of sugarcane biomass. These discoveries are opening the way to increased efficiency of pretreatments and hydrolysis, being therefore important information for 2nd generation processes as well as for biorefinery initiatives. Part II focuses on the discovery and characterization of hydrolases from microorganisms that could be used in industrial processes. Recent advances in the search for hydrolases using metagenomics is reported. A great number of genes and enzymes from microorganisms have been discovered, affording improvement of enzyme cocktails better adapted to sugarcane biomass. Part III reports two key issues in the process of 2G ethanol, pentose fermentation and sugarcane genetics. These are the discoveries of new yeast species capable of producing ethanol more efficiently from xylose and the advances made on the sugarcane genetics, a key issue to design varieties adapted to 2G ethanol production. Part IV approaches sustainability through two chapters, one discussing the sustainability of the sugarcane agricultural and environmental system and another discussing how national and mainly international policies of Brazil regarding 2G ethanol production affected the country’s strategies to establish itself as an international player in renewable energy area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Book","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034569615"

This article provides a thorough analysis of the education of researchers that constitute the main Brazilian research groups, using data on about 6,000 researchers involved in the country's National Institutes of Science and Technology (INCT) initiative. Data on the steps taken by each researcher in her education, from the bachelor's degree to doctorate, including a possible postdoctoral experience, and employment, are extracted from an official curriculum vitae repository. The location and the time at which each career step occurred define spatiotemporal career trajectories. We then analyze such trajectories considering additional data, including the area of knowledge of the INCTs to which each researcher is associated. We found an increasing prevalence of Brazilian institutions in the education of Brazilian scientists, as the number of doctorates earned abroad is decreasing over time. Postdoctoral stages, on the other hand, often take place in Europe or in the United States. Taking an international postdoctoral position after a full education in Brazil suggests a drive towards seeking higher-level exchange and cooperation with foreign groups in a more advanced career stage. Results also show that Brazilian researchers tend to seek employment in regions that are close to the institutions at which they received their bachelor's degrees, suggesting low mobility within the country.

In Brazil, speciesLink is an e-infrastructure that offers free and open access to data from more than 300 biological and data collections. SpeciesLink's thematic network, INCT-Virtual Herbarium of Plants and Fungi and the List of Species of the Brazilian Flora, are used as primary data sources to develop Lacunas, an information system with a public web interface that generates detailed reports of the status of plant species occurrence data. Lacunas also integrates information about endemism, conservation status, and collecting efforts over time. Here we describe the motivation and the functionality of this system, showing how it can be useful in detecting under-sampled plant species and geographic areas. We show examples of how knowledge can be extracted from biodiversity primary data using Lacunas. For instance, Lacunas report revealed that 111 angiosperm species (10.3 %), currently considered Data Deficient (DD) in the Official List of Threatened Brazilian Flora, have their distribution well characterized.

F., Departamento de Oceanografia, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","The marine environment is certainly one of the most complex systems to study, not only because of the challenges posed by the nature of the waters, but especially due to the interactions of physical, chemical and biological processes that control the cycles of the elements. Together with analytical chemists, oceanographers have been making a great effort in the advancement of knowledge of the distribution patterns of trace elements and processes that determine their biogeochemical cycles and influences on the climate of the planet. The international academic community is now in prime position to perform the first study on a global scale for observation of trace elements and their isotopes in the marine environment (GEOTRACES) and to evaluate the effects of major global changes associated with the influences of megacities distributed around the globe. This action can only be performed due to the development of highly sensitive detection methods and the use of clean sampling and handling techniques, together with a joint international program working toward the clear objective of expanding the frontiers of the biogeochemistry of the oceans and related topics, including climate change issues and ocean acidification associated with alterations in the carbon cycle. It is expected that the oceanographic data produced this coming decade will allow a better understanding of biogeochemical cycles, and especially the assessment of changes in trace elements and contaminants in the oceans due to anthropogenic influences, as well as its effects on ecosystems and climate. Computational models are to be constructed to simulate the conditions and processes of the modern oceans and to allow predictions. The environmental changes arising from human activity since the 18th century (also called the Anthropocene) have made the Earth System even more complex. Anthropogenic activities have altered both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and the legacy of these impacts in the oceans include: a) pollution of the marine environment by solid waste, including plastics; b) pollution by chemical and medical (including those for veterinary use) substances such as hormones, antibiotics, legal and illegal drugs, leading to possible endocrine disruption of marine organisms; and c) ocean acidification, the collateral effect of anthropogenic emissions of CO<inf>2</inf> into the atmosphere, irreversible in the human life time scale. Unfortunately, the anthropogenic alteration of the hydrosphere due to inputs of plastics, metal, hydrocarbons, contaminants of emerging concern and even with formerly ""exotic"" trace elements, such us rare earth elements is likely to accelerate in the near future. These emerging contaminants would likely soon present difficulties for studies in pristine environments. All this knowledge brings with it a great responsibility: helping to envisage viable adaptation and mitigation solutions to the problems identified. The greatest challenge faced by Brazil is currently to create a framework project to develop education, science and technology applied to oceanography and related areas. This framework would strengthen the present working groups and enhance capacity building, allowing a broader Brazilian participation in joint international actions and scientific programs. Recently, the establishment of the National Institutes of Science and Technology (INCTs) for marine science, and the creation of the National Institute of Oceanographic and Hydrological Research represent an exemplary start. However, the participation of the Brazilian academic community in the latest assaults on the frontier of chemical oceanography is extremely limited, largely due to: i. absence of physical infrastructure for the preparation and processing of field samples at ultra-trace level; ii. limited access to oceanographic cruises, due to the small number of Brazilian vessels and/or absence of ""clean"" laboratories on board; iii. restricted international cooperation; iv. limited analytical capacity of Brazilian institutions for the analysis of trace elements in seawater; v. high cost of ultrapure reagents associated with processing a large number of samples, and vi. lack of qualified technical staff. Advances in knowledge, analytic capabilities and the increasing availability of analytical resources available today offer favorable conditions for chemical oceanography to grow. The Brazilian academic community is maturing and willing to play a role in strengthening the marine science research programs by connecting them with educational and technological initiatives in order to preserve the oceans and to promote the development of society.

The Bolsa Familia Programme (BFP) is a widespread conditional cash transfer programme, launched in 2003, which transfers cash to poor households (maximum income US$70 per person a month) when they comply with conditions related to health and education. Transfers range from $18 to $175 per month, depending on the income and composition of the family. We aimed to assess the effect of the BFP on deaths of children younger than 5 years (under-5), overall and resulting from specific causes associated with poverty: malnutrition, diarrhoea, and lower respiratory infections. Methods The study had a mixed ecological design. It covered the period from 2004-09 and included 2853 (of 5565) municipalities with death and livebirth statistics of adequate quality. We used government sources to calculate all-cause under-5 mortality rates and under-5 mortality rates for selected causes. BFP coverage was classified as low (0·0-17·1%), intermediate (17·2-32·0%), high (>32·0%), or consolidated (>32·0% and target population coverage ≥100% for at least 4 years). We did multivariable regression analyses of panel data with fixed-effects negative binomial models, adjusted for relevant social and economic covariates, and for the effect of the largest primary health-care scheme in the country (Family Health Programme). Findings Under-5 mortality rate, overall and resulting from poverty-related causes, decreased as BFP coverage increased. The rate ratios (RR) for the effect of the BFP on overall under-5 mortality rate were 0·94 (95% CI 0·92-0·96) for intermediate coverage, 0·88 (0·85-0·91) for high coverage, and 0·83 (0·79-0·88) for consolidated coverage. The effect of consolidated BFP coverage was highest on under-5 mortality resulting from malnutrition (RR 0·35; 95% CI 0·24-0·50) and diarrhoea (0·47; 0·37-0·61). Interpretation A conditional cash transfer programme can greatly contribute to a decrease in childhood mortality overall, and in particular for deaths attributable to poverty-related causes such as malnutrition and diarrhoea, in a large middle-income country such as Brazil.

It will be crucial that such intent will include a large parcel of sustainability so that more renewable energy becomes available for populations. Because large amounts of energy are ""hidden"" in carbon polymers made by plants, notably carbohydrates, it is obvious that if technologies are developed to produce liquid fuels such as ethanol from carbohydrate polymers such as cellulose, men could significantly increase energy sustainability . This book reviews general aspects of biomass utilization for bioenergy production as well as strategies using biochemistry, molecular biology, chemistry and physics to disassemble plant cell walls. Recent discoveries of basic science under development in several laboratories in the world are reviewed by experts that have been intensively working with many aspects that will impact the development of the technology of production of cellulosic ethanol. Marcos S. Buckeridge, is a biologist who worked for more than 20 years with the structure and function of plant cell walls. After many years at the Botanical Garden of São Paulo, he moved to the University of São Paulo where incorporated in his lines of research investigation of sugarcane cell walls and sugarcane physiology. At the same time he founded the Laboratory or Plant Physiological Ecology (LAFIECO) dedicated exclusively to study the effects of the global climate changes on crop and native rain forest species. He will be one of the lead authors of the IPCC report for 2014. Buckeridge helped to found the BioEn-FAPESP, one or the most important research programs in bioenergy in Brazil. More recently he became coordinator of the National Institute of Science and Technology of Bioethanol, and is now the scientific director of the Brazilian Bioethanol Science and Technology National Laboratory (CTBE) at Campinas, Brazil.

The information gathered was processed and an electronic toxicology database (http://www.inct-ta.furg.br/bd-toxicologico.php) was generated. This database provides valuable information for researchers to select sensitive and tolerant aquatic species to a large variety of aquatic pollutants. Furthermore, the toxicology database allows researchers to select species representative of an ecosystem of interest. Analysis of the toxicology database showed that ecotoxicological assays have significantly improved in Brazil over the last decade, in spite of the still relatively low number of tests performed and the restricted number of native species tested. This is because most of the research is developed in a few laboratories concentrated in certain regions of Brazil, especially in Southern and Southeast regions. Considering the extremely rich biodiversity and the large variety of aquatic ecosystems in Brazil, this finding points to the urgent need for the development of ecotoxicological studies with other groups of aquatic animals, such as insects, foraminifera, cnidarians, worms, amphibians, among others. This would help to derive more realistic water quality criteria (WQC) values, which would better protect the different aquatic ecosystems in Brazil. Finally, the toxicology database generated presents solid and science based information, which can encourage and drive the Environmental Regulatory Agencies in Brazil to derive WQC based on native species. In this context, the present paper discusses the historical evolution of ecotoxicological studies in Brazil, and how they have contributed to the improvement of the Brazilian Federal and Regional regulations for environment. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Ecotoxicologia Aquatica Principios E Aplicacoes, (2006); Verslycke, Tim A., The toxicity of metal mixtures to the estuarine mysid Neomysis integer (Crustacea: Mysidacea) under changing salinity, Aquatic Toxicology, 64, 3, pp. 307-315, (2003); Concepts Methods and Data Sources for Cumulative Health Risk Assessment of Multiple Chemicals Exposures and Effects A Resource Document, (2007); Toxicity Reduction and Toxicity Identification Evaluations for Effluents Ambient Waters and Other Aqueous Media, (2005); Fish Physiology Recent Advances, (1986); Grosell, M.
