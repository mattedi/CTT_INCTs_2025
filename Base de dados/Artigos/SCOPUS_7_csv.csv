Methods: Between July 21, 2020, and July 29, 2021, 13,166 participants provided informed consent, with 12,688 randomized for the trial. Participants were allocated between vaccine and placebo arms (1:1) and monitored for symptomatic COVID-19 cases, severity of disease, and adverse reactions after two doses given 14 days apart. Findings: The primary efficacy analysis revealed a vaccine efficacy of 50⸱4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 35·3 % to 62·0 %; p = 0·0049) in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, leading to the issuance of Emergency Use Authorization for CoronaVac in January 2021. Upon completion of follow-up, vaccine efficacy was 44⸱6 % [95 % CI, 34·9 % to 52·8 %; p = 0·0023] in preventing COVID-19 and 82⸱1 % (95 % CI, 64·9 % to 90·9 %; p < 0·0001) in preventing severe COVID-19. Safety data indicated that adverse reactions were more frequent in the vaccine arm, primarily mild to moderate, with pain at the injection site and headache being the most common. Interpretation: CoronaVac demonstrated moderate efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and high efficacy against severe disease. While reactions were slightly more common in the vaccine group, they were generally mild and manageable.

This study aimed to describe the temporal evolution of opioid consumption in hospitalised patients in a Brazilian hospital network. Methods: This study describes a 12-year time-series (2009–2020) of hospital use of opioids in 28 hospitals of a private network in Brazil. More than four million prescriptions were analyzed using the Joinpoint Regression Program. Findings: Parenteral tramadol was the most consumed opioid, followed by parenteral fentanyl and parenteral morphine. Among enteral opioids, the most commonly used was codeine followed by tramadol. There were several variations in the use patterns for most medications, with periods of significant increases and decreases, but two opioids underwent considerable change: parenteral fentanyl, which doubled in consumption, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and enteral tramadol, which had a fourfold reduction over time. Enteral oxycodone, the pivot of the opioid crisis in the USA, was relatively little used in this series. Methadone, both parenteral and enteral, was seldom used at the hospitals under analysis, an indicator of a mild use of other opioids, before and/or during hospitalisation. Interpretation: Knowledge and documentation of the utilisation profile of this class of medication is relevant, given the concern that any increase in consumption at any point in the chain, including during hospitalisations, may trigger events of increased outpatient opioid use and potential misuse.

The host factors associated with disease pathogenesis have nonetheless remained obscure, and little is known about the immune determinants of protection against OROV. Methods: We tracked morbidity, mortality, viral loads, and serum neutralisation in wild-type (WT), Rag1−/−, CD19-Cre+ Ifnarfl, and CD19-Cre+ MyD88fl mice and performed immunophenotyping experiments, passive serum transfers, and adoptive cell transfers to determine how early antibody responses and B cell subsets control viral replication and dissemination to the central nervous system after infection with OROV. Findings: In line with a protective role for B cells, WT mice efficiently produced OROV-specific antibodies within 6 days of infection. Serum transfer containing neutralising IgM from WT to Rag1−/− mice prevented neurological disease in OROV-challenged mice. CD19-Cre+ MyD88fl mice but not CD19-Cre+ Ifnarfl mice were vulnerable to neurological disease and produced lower titres of OROV-specific antibodies that exhibited suboptimal neutralisation and potency compared with MyD88-sufficient mice. CD19-Cre+ MyD88fl mice also presented with reduced numbers of marginal zone B (MZB) cells and plasmablasts after infection, which were associated with high viral burdens and lethality. Adoptive transfer of MZB cells from WT mice protected CD19-Cre+ MyD88fl mice and partially protected Rag1−/− mice from lethal infection with OROV. Interpretation: Early MyD88 signalling in B cells is required for optimal antibody responses that limit viral replication and neurological disease in mice infected with OROV.

We aimed to develop and assess AI models for automatic classification of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) clinical images through a Deep Learning (DL) approach, and to explore explainability using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Methods: This study assessed a dataset of 778 clinical images of OPMD and OSCC, divided into training, model optimization, and internal testing subsets with an 8:1:1 proportion. Transfer learning strategies were applied to pre-train 8 convolutional neural networks (CNN). Performance was evaluated by mean accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values. Grad-CAM qualitative appraisal was performed to assess explainability. Findings: ConvNeXt and MobileNet CNNs showed the best performance. Transfer learning strategies enhanced performance for both algorithms, and the greatest model achieved mean accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and AUROC of 0.799, 0.837, 0.756, 0.794 and 0.863 during internal testing, respectively. MobileNet displayed the lowest computational cost. Grad-CAM analysis demonstrated discrepancies between the best-performing model and the highest explainability model. Interpretation: ConvNeXt and MobileNet DL models accurately distinguished OSCC from OPMD in clinical photographs taken with different types of image-capture devices. Grad-CAM proved to be an outstanding tool to improve performance interpretation. Obtained results suggest that the adoption of DL models in healthcare could aid in diagnostic assistance and decision-making during clinical practice.
