A broad set of bibliometric indicators derived from the Web of Science Core Collection database and InCites electronic analytical tool were used to assess the scientific output of the Soviet and Russian research establishments. Various aspects of path dependence of contemporary Russia’s patterns of publication activity on the earlier institutional models of the R&D sector established in the Soviet Union were considered. This path dependence may be clearly observed in the thematic structure of scientific publications (even more so in internationally collaborated papers), in the composition of partner countries for joint publications, and in citation indicators. The evolution of national science policies is tracked in the context of historical development of policy instruments and government actions intended to stimulate and support the publication activity of Russian (and Soviet) academics and maximize their potential effects upon the country’s key research performance indicators. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bibliometric Indicators; Path-dependence; Publication Activity Dynamics; Science Policy Evolution; Science Policy Impact; Soviet R&d Sector","Almquist, Roland, Public sector governance and accountability, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 24, 7-8, pp. 479-487, (2013); Amabile, Teresa M., Motivating creativity in organizations: On doing what you love and loving what you do, California Management Review, 1, pp. 39-58, (1997); Andersen, Lotte Bøgh, Not just for the money?""

To conduct reasonable analyses, four types of academic staff accompanied with salary paid were used as the input measures and two indexed measures of output which include students taught and research performance. Using various DEA models, we obtained different estimates for efficiency scores which show that the type of model used affects the efficiency scores. We also found that average efficiency is relatively high and about one half of all academic departments at the university, based on the results of input-oriented variable return to scale models, perform efficiently. The results of the DEA models employed also illustrate the existence of scale inefficiencies and the relatively large heterogeneity among the departments. However, we did not find sufficient evidence supporting efficiency heterogeneity across different fields of study (i.e., humanities and social sciences against sciences and engineering). The determinants of departmental efficiency were also examined. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Envelopment Analysis; Dea; Education; Efficiency Evaluation; Iran; Iranian Academic Departments; Research Performance; Scale Effects","Abbott, Malcolm J., The efficiency of Australian universities: A data envelopment analysis, Economics of Education Review, 22, 1, pp. 89-97, (2003); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2013); Bulletin of Operations Research and Its Applications, (2013); Agha, Salah R., Assessment of academic departments efficiency using data envelopment analysis, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management, 4, 2, pp. 301-325, (2011); Ahn, Taesik, Some statistical and DEA evaluations of relative efficiencies of public and private institutions of higher learning, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences, 22, 6, pp. 259-269, (1988); Ali, Imran, Estimating technical efficiency of academic departments: Case of government PG college, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 584, pp. 405-417, (2018); Education Economics, (1997); Avkiran, Necmi Kemal, Investigating technical and scale efficiencies of Australian universities through data envelopment analysis, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences, 35, 1, pp. 57-80, (2001); Humanities Instructor Journal, (2006); Journal of Education and Practice, (2014)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059778674"

Relying on scientometric and lexicometric tools, we analyze the metadata and content of a corpus of articles from the journals Games Studies and Games & Culture and of Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA) proceedings. We show that published researches have been studying only a limited set of game genres and that they especially focus on online games. We then expose the different ways game studies are talking about games through a topic model analysis of our corpus. We test two hypotheses to explain the concentration of research on singular objects: path dependence and trading zone. We describe integrative properties of the focus on common objects but stress also the scientific limits met by this tendency. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Epistemic Culture; Game Studies; Interdisciplinarity; Lexicometric Analysis; Multidisciplinarity; Path Dependence; Sociology Of Science; Topic Modeling; Trading Zone; World Of Warcraft (wow)","Game Studies, (2001); American Journal of Sociology, (2013); Apperley, Thomas H., Genre and game studies: Toward a critical approach to video game genres, Simulation and Gaming, 37, 1, pp. 6-23, (2006); Eludamos Journal for Computer Game Culture, (2009); Art Worlds, (1982); Text Mining Theory and Applications, (2009); Distinction A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, (1984); Situating Play Cultures A Survey on Videogames and Culture in France, (2013); Sociologie, (2016); Loading, (2011)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027579475"

The use of only quantitative indicators, however, provides insufficient information for evaluating a country's strategic research areas. Understanding the universities' fields of specializations and research strengths based on content-based analysis is also crucial for supporting areas of research excellence and promoting collaboration in a country. In this study, a multiphase analysis beginning with benchmarking of research performance and then identifying research strengths of the Thailand National Research Universities (NRUs) via a content-based co-citation analysis was performed. The data were retrieved from the ISI-Web of Science during 2009-13. The main findings show that most core research strengths of the high-performing NRUs were in common with the national S&T strategic plan announced in 2006. Each university also has the expertise related to its organizational path dependence and research infrastructures. In addition, we can identify the research areas which the NRUs still lack or have low performance. Rather than providing only the broad mission and general information about the university's research fields, a university should also promote its expertise and the up-to-date core research interests. On the other hand, policymakers need to understand the international trend, monitor the universities' research strengths dynamically, and balance them with the domestic needs. They should also act as intermediaries in research collaboration by matching the universities' useful research for other actors in the national innovation system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Co-citation; National Research Universities; Research Strength; Web Of Science","Agasisti, Tommaso, Evaluating the performance of academic departments: An analysis of research-related output efficiency, Research Evaluation, 21, 1, pp. 2-14, (2012); Aksnes, Dag W., Ranking national research systems by citation indicators.
