Historically, the book examines the working of the opposition in four phases-the Formative Phase (1952-1966), the Resilience Phase (1967-1984), the Consolidation Phase (1985-1998) and the Fragmentation Phase (1999-2014); parallelly, the question of the opposition is framed in two facets: as democracy's necessity and as a governance imperative. It shows how the representational assertion in Indian politics enabled the expansion of the opposition, but by generating fragmentation and making ideologicallyneutral coalitions both possible and necessary, it also contributed to its weakening as a mechanism of exacting accountability. This book invites the reader to reimagine the idea of democracy, political system and governance from the perspective of the opposition. Why is the opposition essential? What is the constitutional and institutional protection to ensure an effective and vibrant opposition under a one-party dominant system? It also adopts a narrative style, making it accessible to all kinds of readers. This book will be useful to those interested in understanding Indian politics, democracy, political processes and institutions. Students, researchers, academicians of political science, governance and public policy will find this work engaging. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Constituent Assembly Debates, (2014); Lok Sabha Debates, (1952); Lok Sabha Debates, (1963); Lok Sabha Debates, (1964); Lok Sabha Debates, (1973); Lok Sabha Debates, (1975); Lok Sabha Debates, (1977); Lok Sabha Debates, (1986); Lok Sabha Debates, (1989); Lok Sabha Debates, (1990)","Book","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000641058"

It unpacks the perception of the Global South as a hotbed for scandalous ‘firsts’. That is, there seems to be a tendency for these regions to chase major scientific breakthroughs and global recognition, often at the cost of transgressing scientific and/or ethical norms. By analysing two kinds of scientific scandals–described as ‘science out of place’ and ‘science out of pace’–this paper highlights both the challenges and opportunities for RRI to ‘de-link’ from hegemonic perceptions of legitimacy in science and to promote productive epistemic socialisation. This is essential to develop our ethical sensibility in the fast evolving and inherently contentious field of biotechnology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Nature, (2024); undefined, (2017); Current Science, (1997); Aragaw, Fantu Mamo, Individual and community level predictors of women's autonomy in health care decision-making among youth in East African countries: A multilevel analysis, BMJ Open, 13, 6, (2023); Baćević, Jana, Epistemic injustice and epistemic positioning: towards an intersectional political economy, Current Sociology, 71, 6, pp. 1122-1140, (2023); Banerjee, Dwaipayan, Provincializing bioethics: Dilemmas of end-of-life care in an Indian ICU, American Ethnologist, 49, 3, pp. 318-331, (2022); Bärnreuther, Sandra, Innovations ‘Out of Place’: Controversies Over IVF Beginnings in India Between 1978 and 2005, Medical Anthropology: Cross Cultural Studies in Health and Illness, 35, 1, pp. 73-89, (2016); Barugahare, John Banson, African bioethics: Methodological doubts and insights, BMC Medical Ethics, 19, 1, (2018); undefined, (2018); Bharadwaj, Aditya, Ethic of consensibility, subaltern ethicality: The clinical application of embryonic stem cells in India, BioSocieties, 8, 1, pp. 25-40, (2013)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017038152"

Actors in funding bodies experience similar tensions, however. While projectification necessitates predictability and individual project objectives, research funding is also increasingly organized in networks promoting local experimentation. Moreover, funding bodies are part of a system of accountability in which investments are legitimized politically in often reductionist ways. We argue for the salience of more detailed empirical investigations into the work of funding bodies as they navigate these tensions. We apply a dramaturgical perspective to investigate the “staging work” of program committees responsible for the management of funded programs, identifying three forms of staging work: setting the scene, temporal narration, and signifying success. All come with discursive, material, and symbolic dimensions. We develop the notion “adaptive coherence” to show how the program committee sought to maintain the coherence of the overall program despite continuous risks of fragmentation due to projectification, local experimentation, and divergence in interests. “Adaptive coherence” proves productive in incorporating the temporal and spatial dimensions of staging work in networked contexts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Asdal, Kristin, Experiments in Context and Contexting, Science Technology and Human Values, 37, 4, pp. 291-306, (2012); Bailey, Simon R., The policy work of piloting: Mobilising and managing conflict and ambiguity in the English NHS, Social Science and Medicine, 179, pp. 210-217, (2017); Engaging Science Technology and Society, (2017); Bal, Roland A., Practicing Corona – Towards a research agenda of health policies, Health Policy, 124, 7, pp. 671-673, (2020); Paradox of Scientific Authority the Role of Scientific Advice in Democracies, (2009); American Sociological Review, (1954); Braun, Dietmar, Principal-agent theory and research policy: An introduction, Science and Public Policy, 30, 5, pp. 302-308, (2003); Broer, Tineke, Problematisations of Complexity: On the Notion and Production of Diverse Complexities in Healthcare Interventions and Evaluations, Science as Culture, 26, 2, pp. 135-160, (2017); Graeme Currie, Graeme A., Spanning boundaries in pursuit of effective knowledge sharing within networks in the NHS, Journal of Health Organization and Management, 21, 4-5, pp. 406-417, (2007); Evaluation Society, (2012)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104275099"

However, the system has developed important deficiencies and limitations that are causing harm to sports, athletes and society. These issues are related to the lack of evidence for most substances on the Prohibited List for performance or negative health effects, a lack of transparency and accountability of governance and decision-making by WADA and the extension of anti-doping policies outside the field of professional sports. This article tries to identify these deficiencies and limitations and presents a plea for more science, better governance and more education.

Formal government and legal structures further constrain the adaptive capacity of our SETs. However, new, selforganized forms of adaptive governance are emerging at multiple scales in natural resource-based SETs. Adaptive governance involves the private and public sectors as well as formal and informal institutions, self-organized to fill governance gaps in the traditional roles of states. While new governance forms are emerging, they are not yet doing so rapidly enough to match the pace of environmental change. Furthermore, they do not yet possess the legitimacy or capacity needed to address disparities between the winners and losers from change. These emergent forms of adaptive governance appear to be particularly effective in managing complexity. We explore governance and SETs as coevolving complex systems, focusing on legal systems to understand the potential pathways and obstacles to equitable adaptation. We explore how governments may facilitate the emergence of adaptive governance and promote legitimacy in both the process of governance despite the involvement of nonstate actors, and its adherence to democratic values of equity and justice. To manage the contextual nature of the results of change in complex systems, we propose the establishment of long-term study initiatives for the coproduction of knowledge, to accelerate learning and synergize interactions between science and governance and to foster public science and epistemic communities dedicated to navigating transitions to more just, sustainable, and resilient futures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","environmental change; government; human; justice; learning; public sector; review; article","Steffen, Will L., The trajectory of the anthropocene: The great acceleration, Anthropocene Review, 2, 1, pp. 81-98, (2015); Hardin, Garrett J., The tragedy of the commons, Science, 162, 3859, pp. 1243-1248, (1968); Rittel, Horst W.J., Dilemmas in a general theory of planning, Policy Sciences, 4, 2, pp. 155-169, (1973); Adaptive Environmental Assessment and Management, (1978); Public Administration Review, (1959); Ostrom, Elinor, Governing the commons: the evolution of institutions for collective action, (1990); Ostrom, Elinor, Polycentric systems for coping with collective action and global environmental change, Global Environmental Change, 20, 4, pp. 550-557, (2010); Bevir, Mark, Key concepts in governance, pp. 1-218, (2009); Clark, William C., Sustainability science: Toward a synthesis, Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 45, pp. 331-386, (2020); Dietz, Thomas M., The Struggle to Govern the Commons, Science, 302, 5652, pp. 1907-1912, (2003)","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114126033"

In contrast to the claims of some critics that the fraud scandalmight raise doubts aboutKorean stem cell science, the impact of theHwang scandal on publications byKorean stem cell researchers in international scientific journals proved limited, with only a temporary halt in research and publications. On the one hand, Korea’s scientific community has moved toward the ethical turn through which theKorean government tightened its research-ethics standards and regulations. On the other hand, the government and scientific community remain hopeful about stem cell research. Consequently, the politics of hope have led to the quick recovery of Korean stem cell science from the potential damage caused by the Hwang scandal. The scandal accelerated the South Korean government’s efforts toward research ethics reform: it mandated universities and research institutes to create and strengthen institutional review boards and other research-integrity committees. In addition, the Korean government, maintaining its optimism about the economic value of stem cell science, continued to fund stem cell research. Despite the seemingly prompt recovery from the scandal, however, stem cell research governance systems in Korea face a serious new challenge: the ethical and safety concerns associated with the rapid commercialization of stem cell science. Therefore, this article views the changes in the scientific community as a process of conflict and negotiation between the accountability crisis in the Korean scientific community and the politics of hope in science. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Bak, Hee-je, The politics of technoscience in Korea: From state policy to social movement, East Asian Science, Technology and Society, 8, 2, pp. 159-174, (2014); undefined, (2007); 2010 Biotechnology Major Statistics Collection, (2011); Science and Engineering Ethics, (1999); Borup, Mads, The sociology of expectations in science and technology, Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 18, 3-4, pp. 285-298, (2006); Betrayers of the Truth, (1982); Brown, Nik, A sociology of expectations: Retrospecting prospects and prospecting retrospects, Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 15, 1, pp. 3-18, (2003); Hwang Wu Suk Gong Gyeok A Deon Gyo Su Ga Jul Gi Se Po Non Mun 14pyeon Jo Jak, (2012); Embodied Progress A Cultural Account of Assisted Conception, (1997); Journal of Higher Education, (1984)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049623635"

Central to the evolving vision for regenerative medicine are stem cells, and now human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Against the promissory and technically innovative backdrop of this technology, there has been a growing concern for legitimacy and integrity in science and innovation. This, in turn, has encouraged discourses around the idea of ‘responsibility’, and the notion of ‘responsible research and innovation’ (RRI), which has gained considerable policy traction in Europe. This paper considers the concept of RRI within the context of a specific European research project: the European Bank for induced pluripotent Stem Cells (EBiSC). EBiSC is a resource development project–a biobank–that has as its stated aims the establishment of a leading European-based bank that will, inter alia, promote wider use of iPSCs and global iPSC banking with the ultimate aim of enhancing the health of people. Specifically, this paper considers how EBiSC’s Phase I (2014–2016) governance activities comply with expectations that might be distilled from RRI, and what RRI might impose on EBiSC’s post-Phase II (2017–2019) entity. In doing so, it offers some guidance on how RRI might be operationalised at the project level. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Black, Julia, What is regulatory innovation?, pp. 1-15, (2005); Northern Ireland Legal Quarterly, (2011); Current Legal Problems, (2009); Final, (2011); Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2014 2015, (2014); undefined; Takahashi, Kazutoshi, Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Adult Human Fibroblasts by Defined Factors, Cell, 131, 5, pp. 861-872, (2007); Vogel, Gretchen, New technique RiPS open stem cell field, Science, 330, 6001, (2010); Bulletin of Science Technology Society, (2011); Towards Responsible Research and Innovation in the Information and Communication Technologies and Security Technologies Fields, (2011)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044360333"
