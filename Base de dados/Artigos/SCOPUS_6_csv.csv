Research funders make substantial investments in digital health research to advance the uptake of evidence-informed digital solutions within health systems, yet their impacts on health and health system outcomes, health equity, policy and practice remain poorly understood. Research impact assessments (RIAs) serve as a vital tool for funders to examine the links between research investments and real-world change. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research commissioned an RIA on its largest digital health program, the eHealth Innovations Partnership Program (eHIPP), to understand the program’s outputs and impacts. Methods: This study applied two complementary frameworks, the Canadian Academy of Heath Science’s (CAHS) Making an Impact Framework and the Canadian Health Services and Policy Research Alliance’s (CHSPRA) Informing Decision-Making Framework, to assess the research impact of the eHIPP program, funded from 2015 to 2021. A mixed-methods approach was taken to collect and analyse data from eHIPP grant recipients and their partners. Results: The eHIPP program supported 22 research teams through a total investment of CAD$ 42M. The RIA revealed impacts in the areas of capacity development, knowledge creation, informing decision-making and health outcomes. The teams generated 36 co-designed, evidenced-informed solutions, 79 publications, 194 presentations and 38 media interviews or articles. Solutions were reported to influence health system practice (52%) and policy (33%), improve health outcomes (62%), enhance equitable access to care (62%), improve patient (62%) and provider experience (52%), increase cost-effectiveness (52%), enhance population health (48%) and improve health equity (43%). Conclusions: This RIA study highlights the importance of stakeholder collaboration, robust partnerships and co-design approaches in effectively integrating patient-centred digital health solutions into health systems. These elements are key to advancing the Quintuple Aim (improved cost, population health and equity and experience of patients and providers) and supporting evidence-informed decisions. This paper presents a first case study applying the CAHS and CHSPRA frameworks to assess the impacts of a large digital health funding program. Further, it explores the program’s outcomes and impacts and highlights considerations, successes and challenges for funders when applying RIA. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Canada; capacity building; clinical practice; cost effectiveness analysis; data analysis; digital health; evidence based medicine; funding; health care access; health care organization; health care policy; health care quality; health care system; health equity; human; information processing; interview; investment; medical decision making; medical research; performance measurement system; population health; publishing; research impact assessment; stakeholder participation; decision making; economics; health care delivery; health impact assessment; health services research; program evaluation; telemedicine; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Digital Health; Health Equity; Health Impact Assessment; Health Policy; Health Services Research; Humans; Program Evaluation; Telemedicine","Commonwealth Fund, (2021); Nam Perspect, (2022); Manteghinejad, Amirreza, Challenges and opportunities of digital health in a post-COVID19 world, Journal of Research in Medical Sciences, 26, 1, (2021); Mumtaz, Hassan, Current challenges and potential solutions to the use of digital health technologies in evidence generation: a narrative review, Frontiers in Digital Health, 5, (2023); Ho, Kendall, Defining ""Essential Digital Health for the Underserved, Healthcare Papers, 24, 4, pp. 5-14, (2024); Ardern, Clare L., Trustworthy Evidence to Support Quality Digital Healthcare Policy for Underserved Communities: What Needs to Happen to Translate Evidence into Policy?, Healthcare Papers, 24, 4, pp. 64-75, (2024); Adam, Paula, ISRIA statement: Ten-point guidelines for an effective process of research impact assessment, Health Research Policy and Systems, 16, 1, (2018); Abudu, Rachel M., What funders are doing to assess the impact of their investments in health and biomedical research, Health Research Policy and Systems, 20, 1, (2022); undefined; Innovations Empowering Patients Enabling Better Health Care 2024, (2024)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008972578"

This scoping review investigates the role of the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) in motor recovery of the paretic upper limb following stroke, examining its structural and functional changes and compensatory roles. Methods: A systematic search for scoping review was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar following PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Studies examining contralesional M1 contributions to upper limb recovery in humans and animal models were included. Data were extracted, synthesized qualitatively, and assessed for risk of bias using SYRCLE and Cochrane tools. Results: A total of 38 studies were included in the analysis, consisting of 34 focused on stroke patients and 4 utilizing animal models. The findings revealed the dual and task-specific role of the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) in upper limb recovery after stroke. In patients with severe motor impairments, contralesional M1 supported recovery through compensatory mechanisms, such as increased neuronal recruitment and functional reorganization. However, in cases with mild impairments, its activation was associated with inhibitory effects on ipsilesional reorganization, potentially delaying optimal recovery. Animal studies provided evidence of structural and functional plasticity, including dendritic remodeling and enhanced neuronal connectivity, which paralleled improvements in motor function. In human studies, contralesional M1 activation was task-dependent, with pronounced engagement during demanding tasks and unimanual movements. Ipsilateral motor deficits, including reduced dexterity, strength, and coordination, were commonly reported and underscored the disrupted interhemispheric dynamics influencing recovery. Neuromodulation techniques showed promise in modulating interhemispheric interactions and enhancing motor outcomes. These results emphasize the complex interplay between compensatory and inhibitory processes mediated by contralesional M1 in stroke recovery. Conclusion: The contralesional M1 plays a complex, task-specific role in upper limb recovery after stroke, acting as both a compensatory resource and a potential inhibitory factor. Future research should stratify patients by impairment severity to refine therapeutic approaches.

However, humans with rare genetic mutations in the dec2 gene present an exception; these individuals sleep less without the usual effects associated with sleep deprivation. Thus, it has been suggested that the dec2 short sleep mutations activate compensatory mechanisms that allow these individuals to thrive with less sleep. To test this directly, we used a Drosophila model to study the effects of the dec2P384R mutation on animal health. Expression of a human dec2P384R mutation in sleep-controlling neurons reduces sleep, and, remarkably, the short sleeping flies live significantly longer with improved health. The improved physiological effects were enabled, in part, by enhanced mitochondrial fitness and upregulation of multiple stress response pathways. Additionally, we demonstrate that dec2P384R boosts mitochondrial respiratory capacity in both flies and mammalian cells, suggesting a conserved mechanism by which this mutation promotes healthy aging. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Keene, Alex C., The origins and evolution of sleep, Journal of Experimental Biology, 221, 11, (2018); Cappuccio, Francesco Paolo, Sleep duration predicts cardiovascular outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies, European Heart Journal, 32, 12, pp. 1484-1492, (2011); Kwok, Chun Shing, Self-reported sleep duration and quality and cardiovascular disease and mortality: A dose-response meta-analysis, Journal of the American Heart Association, 7, 15, (2018); Laaboub, Nermine, Insomnia disorders are associated with increased cardiometabolic disturbances and death risks from cardiovascular diseases in psychiatric patients treated with weight-gain-inducing psychotropic drugs: results from a Swiss cohort, BMC Psychiatry, 22, 1, (2022); Sejbuk, Monika, Sleep Quality: A Narrative Review on Nutrition, Stimulants, and Physical Activity as Important Factors, Nutrients, 14, 9, (2022); Scullin, Michael K., Is cognitive aging associated with levels of REM sleep or slow wave sleep?, Sleep, 38, 3, pp. 335-336, (2015); Zhai, Long, Sleep duration and depression among adults: A meta-analysis of prospective studies, Depression and Anxiety, 32, 9, pp. 664-670, (2015); Harper, David G., Differential circadian rhythm disturbances in men with Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal degeneration, Archives of General Psychiatry, 58, 4, pp. 353-360, (2001); Koh, Kyunghee, Identification of SLEEPLESS, a sleep-promoting factor, Science, 321, 5887, pp. 372-376, (2008); Medori, Rossella, Fatal familial insomnia, a prion disease with a mutation at codon 178 of the prion protein gene, New England Journal of Medicine, 326, 7, pp. 444-449, (1992)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015086086"

Spontaneous portosystemic shunts (SPSS), a compensatory mechanism for portal hypertension, are closely associated with disease progression. This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models incorporating clinical and imaging features to predict the risk and frequency of rebleeding following initial endoscopic treatment. Methods: This multicenter prospective study enrolled patients with HBV-related cirrhosis and EGVB treated at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University (the development cohort). External validation was completed in five tertiary centers in China. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03277651. Data were collected between January 2017 and January 2022. Five classic ML algorithms, Hierarchical Gradient Boosting (HGB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting with classification trees (XGB), were utilized to predict rebleeding. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. Time-dependent ML was further applied, with predictive performance compared between conventional and time-dependent models using the concordance index (C-index). The optimal model was interpreted via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and externally validated. Additionally, key predictors were integrated into a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to estimate rebleeding frequency. Findings: Among 295 patients in the development cohort and 190 in the external cohort, rebleeding occurred in 77 and 68 patients with SPSS, respectively. The XGB model demonstrated the best discrimination (AUCs: 0.814 internal, 0.776 external), significantly outperforming the other models (P = 0.014, 0.008). Compared with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Child-Pugh scores (AUCs: 0.557 and 0.590), the XGB model significantly improved rebleeding prediction (P < 0.0001). SHAP analysis identified hemoglobin, portal vein thrombosis, superior mesenteric vein diameter, platelet count, minimum shunt diameter, and splenic vein diameter as the top predictors. The SVR model achieved robust performance in estimating rebleeding frequency, with mean squared error (MSE) and R2 values of 0.030 and 0.914 in the training set, 0.073 and 0.777 in the internal validation set, and 0.143 and 0.708 in the external validation set. Interpretation: The ML-based model offers a noninvasive, accurate tool for individualized risk stratification and follow-up planning in patients with HBV-related cirrhosis and SPSS after initial endoscopic therapy.

Neuroimaging studies of unaffected first-degree relatives offer insight into the neurobiology of the disorder. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted in August 2024 to identify Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies comparing unaffected relatives of individuals with OCD to healthy controls. Significant findings were reported based on patterns of brain changes in individuals with OCD and their relatives. Results: A total of 32 studies were reviewed, including 18 functional MRI, 8 structural MRI, and 7 diffusion tensor imaging studies. Despite inconsistencies arising from heterogeneity in imaging modalities, age groups, and analytic methods, certain regions and patterns emerged repeatedly. Results were grouped into four clusters. Cluster 1, the most consistently reported, involved shared or intermediate alterations in relatives, suggesting putative endophenotypes. Frequently implicated regions included the insula, thalamus, dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, and parietal cortex. Cluster 2 described more pronounced alterations in relatives than in OCD patients, often in frontoparietal regions, possibly reflecting preclinical vulnerability or protective features. Cluster 3 showed opposite trends in relatives, particularly in occipital and parietal regions, which may indicate compensatory or protective processes. Although very few, there were some findings that were specific to relatives (cluster 4). Conclusion: This review identifies neuroimaging findings in unaffected relatives of individuals with OCD. Most studies suggest potential endophenotypes, with some reflecting compensatory mechanisms. These findings support further research to validate the proposed clusters and clarify heritable neural markers of OCD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","antidepressant agent; clomipramine; neuroleptic agent; quetiapine; serotonin uptake inhibitor; adult; anterior cingulate; Article; comorbidity; depression; diffusion tensor imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; eating disorder; endophenotype; female; first-degree relative; fractional anisotropy; frontoparietal network; functional connectivity strength; gray matter; human; inferior longitudinal fasciculus; inferior parietal lobule; inhibitory control; insula; male; meta analysis; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obsessive compulsive disorder; occipital cortex; orbital cortex; panic; parietal cortex; posterior cingulate; putamen; relative; reversal learning; sensorimotor network; social phobia; stop signal reaction time; superior frontal gyrus; superior parietal lobule; superior temporal gyrus; supplementary motor area; systematic review; thalamus; tractography; uncinate fasciculus; ventromedial prefrontal cortex; visual network; Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; brain; diagnostic imaging; family; genetics; pathophysiology; Brain; Endophenotypes; Family; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder","Baldi, Samantha, Abnormal white-matter rich-club organization in obsessive–compulsive disorder, Human Brain Mapping, 43, 15, pp. 4699-4709, (2022); Beşirog̃lu, Lütfullah, Cortical thickness and surface area in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder and their unaffected siblings, Brain Imaging and Behavior, 16, 5, pp. 1946-1953, (2022); den Braber, Anouk, An fMRI study in monozygotic twins discordant for obsessive-compulsive symptoms, Biological Psychology, 79, 1, pp. 91-102, (2008); Braff, David L., The importance of endophenotypes in schizophrenia research, Schizophrenia Research, 163, 1-3, pp. 1-8, (2015); Cai, Weidong, Dissociable roles of right inferior frontal cortex and anterior insula in inhibitory control: Evidence from intrinsic and task-related functional parcellation, Connectivity, And response profile analyses across multiple datasets, Journal of Neuroscience, 34, 44, pp. 14652-14667, (2014); Chamberlain, Samuel Robin, Endophenotypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder: Rationale, evidence and future potential, Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics, 9, 8, pp. 1133-1146, (2009); Chamberlain, Samuel Robin, Orbitofrontal dysfunction in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and their unaffected relatives, Science, 321, 5887, pp. 421-422, (2008); De Luca, Vincenzo, Age at onset in Canadian OCD patients: Mixture analysis and systematic comparison with other studies, Journal of Affective Disorders, 133, 1-2, pp. 300-304, (2011); Dikmeer, Nur, White matter microstructure and connectivity in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and their unaffected siblings, Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 143, 1, pp. 72-81, (2021); Dong, Chenjie, Impairment in the goal-directed corticostriatal learning system as a biomarker for obsessive-compulsive disorder, Psychological Medicine, 50, 9, pp. 1490-1500, (2020)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004688297"

We review the causal relationship between ocular diseases and the resulting AHPs. An extensive literature search was conducted to identify and summarize relevant medical studies providing evidence of AHPs in patients diagnosed with conditions like Duane retraction syndrome, Brown syndrome, superior oblique palsy, and other ocular disorders. The analysis explores the proportion of AHP types (head tilt, turn, chin-up/down) and the frequency distribution of ocular conditions for each studied disease. In addition, the degrees of ocular misalignment (hypertropia, hypotropia, esotropia, exotropia) associated with specific AHP manifestations are quantified. Key properties of ocular misalignment and AHPs across different diseases are examined, and Cramer's V statistical measure is employed to assess the association between diseases, AHPs, and ocular misalignment. The findings highlight the need for comprehensive datasets encompassing diverse ocular diseases to support the development of robust artificial intelligence models capable of accurately diagnosing AHPs. This study contributes an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms underlying AHPs and provides a foundation for advancing diagnostic and rehabilitation strategies in vision sciences. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","botulinum toxin A; abnormal head posture; abnormal posture; Brown syndrome; disease association; dissociated vertical deviation; double elevator palsy; Duane retraction syndrome; esotropia; exotropia; eye disease; eye movement; eye movement disorder; eye surgery; head movement; head position; head tilting; human; hypertropia; hypotropia; inferior oblique palsy; monocular elevation deficiency; ophthalmoplegia; pathologic nystagmus; Review; risk factor; superior oblique palsy; systematic review; trochlear nerve palsy; body position; extraocular muscle; head; pathophysiology; physiology; visual field; Eye Movements; Head; Humans; Ocular Motility Disorders; Oculomotor Muscles; Posture; Visual Fields","Admassu, Fisseha, The impact of glaucoma on quality of life in Ethiopia: A case-control study, BMC Ophthalmology, 17, 1, (2017); Chia, Ee Munn, Association between vision and hearing impairments and their combined effects on quality of life, Archives of Ophthalmology, 124, 10, pp. 1465-1470, (2006); Bourne, Rupert R.A., Trends in prevalence of blindness and distance and near vision impairment over 30 years: An analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study, The Lancet Global Health, 9, 2, pp. e130-e143, (2021); Garcia, Giancarlo A., Profound vision loss impairs psychological well-being in young and middle-aged individuals, Clinical Ophthalmology, 11, pp. 417-427, (2017); undefined; Feng, Qi, Expression of IL-4 and IL-12 in the aqueous humor of patients with chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma, Frontiers in Medicine, 11, (2024); Biochem Mol Biol, (2020); Iovino, Claudio, Pars Plana Vitrectomy in Inherited Retinal Diseases: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature, Life, 13, 6, (2023); Duncan, Jacque L., Inherited retinal degenerations: Current landscape and knowledge gaps, Translational Vision Science and Technology, 7, 4, (2018); Tatour, Yasmin, Syndromic inherited retinal diseases: genetic, clinical and diagnostic aspects, Diagnostics, 10, 10, (2020)","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217906131"

This umbrella review aims to synthesize a vast body of evidence from advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of ALS, encompassing a wide range of neuroimaging techniques and patient cohorts. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted an extensive search of four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase) for articles published until 3 December 2024. Data extraction and quality assessment were independently performed using the AMSTAR2 tool. Results: This review included 18 studies that incorporated data from over 29,000 ALS patients. Structural MRI consistently showed gray matter atrophy in the motor and extra-motor regions, with significant white matter (WM) atrophy in the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed metabolic disruptions, including reduced N-acetylaspartate and elevated choline levels. Functional MRI studies have demonstrated altered brain activation patterns and functional connectivity, reflecting compensatory mechanisms and neurodegeneration. fMRI also demonstrated disrupted motor network connectivity and alterations in the default mode network. Diffusion MRI highlighted microstructural changes, particularly reduced fractional anisotropy in the WM tracts. Susceptibility-weighted imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping revealed iron accumulation in the motor cortex and non-motor regions. Perfusion MRI indicated hypoperfusion in regions associated with cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Multiparametric MRI consistently highlights widespread structural, functional, and metabolic changes in ALS, reflecting neurodegeneration and compensatory mechanisms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","biological marker; choline; iron; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; anisotropy; brain atrophy; clinical practice; data quality assessment; default mode network; diagnostic accuracy; diffusion tensor imaging; fractional anisotropy; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; meta analysis; nerve degeneration; neuroimaging; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; perfusion; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; reliability; Review; systematic review; T2 weighted imaging; white matter","Agosta, Federica, Neuroimaging in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: current and emerging uses, Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics, 18, 5, pp. 395-406, (2018); Shojaie, Ali, Non-motor symptoms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, 25, 1-2, pp. 61-66, (2024); Bede, Peter, Spinal cord markers in ALS: Diagnostic and biomarker considerations, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, 13, 5, pp. 407-415, (2012); Mazón, Miguel, Imaging biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases.

This narrative review examines ethical dimensions of AI integration in health systems, drawing from articles published from January 1, 2000 to November 30, 2023, across seven databases—Cochrane Library, PubMed, SCOPUS, Science Direct, BMJ Journals, ProQuest, and SAGE. Using Boolean operators such as “AI” paired with “health”, “health system”, or “hygiene”, the study identifies critical ethical concerns including the preservation of human dignity, confidentiality, informed consent, and the dual principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence. It further highlights systemic challenges like algorithmic bias, transparency gaps in decision-making processes, and disruptions to social justice, alongside legal complexities surrounding accountability for errors, fraud, and compensatory mechanisms. To address these challenges, the study advocates for multilayered solutions. These include establishing ethical audits, formulating policies to ensure equitable global access to AI benefits, and enforcing robust data protection frameworks. Designers are urged to develop comprehensive systems safeguarding patient confidentiality and extending privacy protections to healthcare personnel and affiliated individuals. International regulatory standards must align with social and ethical norms rooted in human dignity, while frameworks for error identification and damage compensation should be prioritized. Continuous adaptation of AI capabilities to evolving medical expertise, coupled with strict adherence to ethical guidelines, is emphasized as essential for sustainable integration of AI in healthcare systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","algorithm bias; artificial intelligence; beneficence; clinical audit; clinical practice guideline; Cochrane Library; computer security; confidentiality; fraud; health care; health care personnel; health care system; human; human dignity; hygiene; informed consent; narrative; nonmaleficence; practice guideline; privacy; review; social justice; systematic review","Han, Euiryoung, Medical education trends for future physicians in the era of advanced technology and artificial intelligence: An integrative review, BMC Medical Education, 19, 1, (2019); Iyanna, Shilpa, Digital transformation of healthcare sector.

Evaluating knee joint loading during activities of daily living postoperatively can offer valuable insights about the compensatory mechanisms in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty patients. The aim of this scoping review was to summarize and to synthesize the existing literature on the most performed activities of daily living and their associated biomechanical outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Methods: Five databases, including Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Ergonomics Abstracts were searched based on 3 main concepts: unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, activities of daily living and biomechanical outcomes. Studies were screened based on titles and abstracts, followed by a full text reading conducted by two authors following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Findings: This scoping review included 17 studies that met the inclusion criteria and focusing on activities of daily living. These activities were categorized into three main subgroups 1) Stair negotiation, 2) Higher degree of knee flexion activities (including squat, lunge and sit-to-stand) and 3) other activities of daily living (including balance, incline and decline walking). Interpretation: Stair negotiation was the most evaluated task followed by squatting with a main focus on reporting knee joint kinematics and kinetics. The majority of studies did not report the use of Patient Reported Outcome Measures combined with motion analysis outcomes. Furthermore, most studies focused primarily on medial knee arthroplasty with a fixed-bearing design in short-term follow-up which warrants caution when generalizing these findings to all types of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ergonomics; Activities of Daily Living; Biomechanical assessment; Clinical assessments; Knee; Knee arthroplasty; Knee joint loading; Knee osteoarthritis; Medline; Scoping review; Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty; Arthroplasty; biomechanics; clinical assessment; daily life activity; follow up; human; kinematics; kinetics; knee arthroplasty; knee function; patient-reported outcome; Review; scoping review; walking speed; knee joint; knee osteoarthritis; knee replacement; pathophysiology; procedures; range of motion; surgery; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Biomechanical Phenomena; Humans; Knee Joint; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Range of Motion, Articular","Ahmad, Sufian S., Follow-up definitions in clinical orthopaedic research A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, Bone and Joint Open, 2, 5, pp. 344-350, (2021); Aljehani, Moiyad, The contralateral knee may not be a valid control for biomechanical outcomes after unilateral total knee arthroplasty, Gait and Posture, 70, pp. 179-184, (2019); Aydemir, Ahmet Nadir, Trends in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, Acta Ortopedica Brasileira, 28, 1, pp. 19-21, (2020); Campbell, Rachel, Perceived benefits and limitations of using patient-reported outcome measures in clinical practice with individual patients: a systematic review of qualitative studies, Quality of Life Research, 31, 6, pp. 1597-1620, (2022); Catani, Fabio, Muscle activity around the knee and gait performance in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty patients: A comparative study on fixed- and mobile-bearing designs, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 20, 6, pp. 1042-1048, (2012); Cheng, T'ao, Fixed- versus mobile-bearing unicondylar knee arthroplasty: Are failure modes different?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 21, 11, pp. 2433-2441, (2013); Collins, Lacee K., Incidence and Trends of High Tibial Osteotomy and Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Over the Past Decade: A Lost Art, Arthroplasty Today, 20, (2023); Dall, Philippa Margaret, Frequency of the sit to stand task: An observational study of free-living adults, Applied Ergonomics, 41, 1, pp. 58-61, (2010); de Vroey, Henri, Hip and knee kinematics of the forward lunge one year after unicondylar and total knee arthroplasty, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 48, pp. 24-30, (2019); Dong, Mingjie, Comparison of spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic gait characteristics in total and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty during level walking: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Gait and Posture, 104, pp. 58-69, (2023)","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005180283"

Understanding the determination of grain yield (GY) in barley is crucial for future advancements in this crop. Objective: This study examines the relationships between the two major components of GY (grain number-GN and grain weight-GW), when driven by genetic and environmental factors. Methods: We compiled data of GY and its numerical components (i.e. GN and GW) to generate a large and unbiased database from every single paper having the word “barley” in the title published over 25 years in four prestigious international journals: Field Crop Research, European Journal of Agronomy, Crop Science and Crop and Pasture Science (formerly Australian Journal of Agricultural Research) between January 1996 and December 2021, both inclusive. Results: GN was significantly better correlated with GY than GW, accounting for 86 % of the variation in GY compared to just 13 % for GW. The changes in GY responsiveness to environmental and genetic factors were mainly due to variations in GN, especially in scenarios with high responsiveness. In contrast, low-responsiveness cases showed trade-offs between GN and GW, suggesting compensatory mechanisms that may not accurately reflect competition for resources. Conclusions: The potential to increase barley GY relies heavily on GN, emphasizing the need to optimise conditions during the critical period of GN determination. Implications: Barley crops under typical field conditions are generally not limited by resource availability during grain filling. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","agricultural production; barley; climate change; crop yield; food security; resource availability; spatiotemporal analysis","Acreche, Martín Moises, Grain weight response to increases in number of grains in wheat in a Mediterranean area, Field Crops Research, 98, 1, pp. 52-59, (2006); Acreche, Martín Moises, Grain weight, radiation interception and use efficiency as affected by sink-strength in Mediterranean wheats released from 1940 to 2005, Field Crops Research, 110, 2, pp. 98-105, (2009); Agegnehu, Getachew, Yield performance and land-use efficiency of barley and faba bean mixed cropping in Ethiopian highlands, European Journal of Agronomy, 25, 3, pp. 202-207, (2006); Alvarez Prado, Santiago, Strategies for yield determination of bread wheat and two-row barley growing under different environments: A comparative study, Field Crops Research, 203, pp. 94-105, (2017); Alvarez Prado, Santiago, Grain growth and development in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.): Coordination between water content and source/sink ratio, Field Crops Research, 302, (2023); Antolín, María Carmen, Growth, yield and solute content of barley in soils treated with sewage sludge under semiarid Mediterranean conditions, Field Crops Research, 94, 2-3, pp. 224-237, (2005); Arisnabarreta, Sebastián, Floret development and grain setting in near isogenic two- and six-rowed barley lines (Hordeum vulgare L.), Field Crops Research, 96, 2-3, pp. 466-476, (2006); Arisnabarreta, Sebastián, Radiation effects on potential number of grains per spike and biomass partitioning in two- and six-rowed near isogenic barley lines, Field Crops Research, 107, 3, pp. 203-210, (2008); Arisnabarreta, Sebastián, Critical period for grain number establishment of near isogenic lines of two- and six-rowed barley, Field Crops Research, 107, 3, pp. 196-202, (2008); Arisnabarreta, Sebastián, Grain number determination under contrasting radiation and nitrogen conditions in 2-row and 6-row barleys, Crop and Pasture Science, 66, 5, pp. 456-465, (2015)","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003230194"
