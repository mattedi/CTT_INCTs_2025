Smith, Universidad Científica del Sur, Lima, Peru","Background: Maternal mortality remains a significant public health issue in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with high incidence rates in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). While maternal mortality decreased by nearly 45% between 1990 and 2015, regional inequalities persist. This study assesses maternal mortality trends in LAC women from 1997 to 2019, providing key insights to address this issue. Methods: An ecological observational time-series study was conducted using data from the WHO Mortality Database for 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean between 1997 and 2019, focusing on women aged 15–49 years. Age-standardized maternal mortality rates (ASMR) per 100,000 person-years were estimated using the direct method, based on the SEGI world standard population. The MMR, defined as maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, was calculated using data from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression to estimate the Annual Percentage Change (APC) and Average Annual Percentage Change (AAPC), with p < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Results: The highest maternal mortality rates in 1997 were reported in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Paraguay, while by 2019, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, and Paraguay had the highest rates. Similarly, the highest maternal mortality ratios (MMRs) in 2019 were observed in Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, and Paraguay. Joinpoint regression identified significant annual reductions in maternal mortality rates in seven countries—particularly Nicaragua (AAPC: −6.7%) and Guatemala (AAPC: −4.2%)—while Venezuela exhibited a significant increase (AAPC: +5.3%). Regarding MMR trends, the most notable improvements were seen in Nicaragua (AAPC: −4.5%) and Costa Rica (AAPC: −2.0%), whereas Brazil, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela experienced significant upward trends. Conclusions: Despite overall progress, regional differences in maternal mortality persist across Latin America and the Caribbean. These variations highlight the importance of strengthening maternal health systems, improving access to skilled birth attendance, and ensuring quality prenatal and postnatal care. Future studies should explore underlying contextual and structural factors driving these trends and promote the use of disaggregated data to inform equitable health policies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","WHO Application of Icd 10 to Deaths During Pregnancy Childbirth and the Puerperium Icd mm, (2012); Alipour, Jahanpour, Prevalence of maternal mortality causes based on ICD-MM: a systematic review and meta-analysis, BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, 23, 1, (2023); Horizonte Sanitario, (2022); Ruas, Carla Alaíde Machado, Profile and spatial distribution on maternal mortality, Revista Brasileira de Saude Materno Infantil, 20, 2, pp. 385-396, (2020); undefined, (2019); Huang, Ryan S., Age-related disparities in national maternal mortality trends: A population-based study, PLOS ONE, 20, 1, (2025); Kurjak, Asim, Why maternal mortality in the world remains tragedy in low-income countries and shame for high-income ones: Will sustainable development goals (SDG) help?, Journal of Perinatal Medicine, 51, 2, pp. 170-181, (2023); Alkema, Leontine, Global, regional, and national levels and trends in maternal mortality between 1990 and 2015, with scenario-based projections to 2030: A systematic analysis by the un Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group, The Lancet, 387, 10017, pp. 462-474, (2016); Saenz, Rocío, Persistent inequities in maternal mortality in Latin America and the Caribbean, 1990–2019, International Journal for Equity in Health, 23, 1, (2024); Nigenda, Gustavo H., Human resources for health and maternal mortality in Latin America and the Caribbean over the last three decades: a systemic-perspective reflections, International Journal for Equity in Health, 23, 1, (2024)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011747392"

Material and Methods: The time series analysis was carried out with secondary data extracted from official databases of the Brazilian Ministry of Health of the external evaluation cycles of the National Program for Improvement of Access and Quality of Primary Health Care (PMAQ-AB). The comparisons of Brazilian regions were performed using Chi-square and Z tests adjusted by the Bonferroni method, and among cycles (years) using the Cochran's Q test (p<0.05). Results: In Brazil, there was an increase in the availability of X-ray equipment between 2014 and 2018 (21.9% vs. 36.3%), and supplies where there was X-ray equipment, which included lead aprons (75.6% vs. 86.4%), dark chamber (darkroom) (86.4% vs. 93.9%) and chemical products for the X-ray film processing (80.7% vs. 86.1%) (p<0.001). The specialized reference in oral radiology was higher in 2018 (71.4%) compared to 2012 (46.8%) and 2014 (66.9%) (p<0.001), with the same trend in the Northeast region (p<0.001). North and Northeast showed growing numbers for most items evaluated, with a reduction in regional inequalities. Conclusion: The availability of equipment, supplies, and specialized reference among Brazilian regions increased.

Despite notable achievements, SUS faces significant challenges, including insufficient funding, inefficiencies, and regional disparities in healthcare quality. Study Design: A literature review. Methods: We reviewed literature from the past five years on SUS's performance, focusing on funding, governance, healthcare quality, and digital technology integration. Results: Urban areas generally receive better healthcare services than rural regions, highlighting substantial disparities. The decentralized governance structure of SUS, involving federal, state, and municipal levels, supports the Family Health Strategy (ESF), which covers 60 % of the population and focuses on prevention and health promotion. Funding constraints have worsened since 2016, leading to resource reductions. Inefficiencies, exacerbated by competition between public and private sectors, result in long waiting times, bed shortages, and a lack of qualified health professionals. While digital transformation driven by public policies could improve service efficiency and accessibility, ensuring digital inclusion is vital for equitable benefits. Social participation is essential for transparency and effective management but is challenged by resource constraints and the need for more decisive social control mechanisms. Conclusions: Future efforts should increase public resources for SUS, address regional inequalities, and integrate digital technologies. Strengthening social participation and reinforcing Brazil's global health leadership is also crucial. After 35 years, SUS remains essential for social inclusion and reducing inequalities, underscoring health as a key investment for equity and population well-being. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ortega, Francisco Javier Guerrero, Brazil's unified health system: 35 years and future challenges, The Lancet Regional Health - Americas, 28, (2023); Paim, Jairnilson Silva, The Brazilian health system: History, advances, and challenges, The Lancet, 377, 9779, pp. 1778-1797, (2011); Andrade, Keitty Regina Cordeiro De, Knowledge translation in the reality of Brazilian public health, Revista de Saude Publica, 54, (2020); Bigoni, Alessandro, Brazil's health system functionality amidst of the COVID-19 pandemic: An analysis of resilience, The Lancet Regional Health - Americas, 10, (2022); Bastos, Luzia Beatriz Rodrigues, Practices and challenges on coordinating the Brazilian unified health system, Revista de Saude Publica, 54, (2020); Campos, Gastão Wagner De Sousa, Healthcare reform and the Unified Health System (SUS), Ciencia e Saude Coletiva, 27, 7, (2022); Towards Universal Health Care in Emerging Economies, (2017); undefined, (2021); undefined, (2023); Machado, Cristiani Vieira, Political struggles for a universal health system in Brazil: Successes and limits in the reduction of inequalities, Globalization and Health, 15, (2019)","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010490556"

Achieving uniform reductions in early-life mortality remains a critical public health challenge in Brazil. This study analyzed disaggregated trends in early-life mortality across Brazilian regions and assessed each region's progress toward meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and national targets for Brazil. Methods: This is a population-based analytical and ecological study. We analyzed data from official government information systems for Brazilian regions and states over five consecutive five-year periods between 1998 and 2022. The SDG targets considered were: an under-five mortality rate (U5MR) of 25 per 1000 live births, a neonatal mortality rate (NMR) of 12.0 per 1000 live births, and an infant mortality rate (IMR) of 15.7 per 1000 live births. Brazil's adjusted national targets were: U5MR of 8.3, NMR of 5.3, and IMR of 7.7 per 1000 live births, respectively. We calculated the absolute annual change (AAC) in mortality rates for each five-year interval to assess trends and infer the likelihood of meeting the 2030 targets. Findings: Between 1998 and 2022, U5MR in Brazil declined by 54%, from 32.5 to 15.1 deaths per 1000 live births. The national average met the SDG targets for all age strata, but no state achieved the stricter IPEA targets. From 2018 to 2022, under-five and infant mortality rates showed annual increases (AAC = +0.22 and + 0.10, respectively), while neonatal mortality remained stable (AAC = −0.02). Regional disparities persisted. In 2022, Santa Catarina (South region) had the lowest U5MR (11.5 deaths per 1000 live births), while Roraima (North region) had the highest (24.6 deaths per 1000 live births). Although most states are projected to meet the SDG targets for U5MR by 2030, none are on track to meet the IPEA goals. Interpretation: Despite national progress in meeting SDG targets for early-life mortality, recent increases in under-five and infant deaths and enduring regional inequalities threaten future gains. Sustained improvements will require focused, region-specific strategies to address the social and health determinants driving these disparities.

In the Amazon, high rates of malnutrition and the alarming rise of obesity highlight persistent regional inequalities. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze spatial distributions and temporal trends of malnutrition among children under five, adults, and elderly individuals in primary healthcare services across municipalities in the Legal Amazon from 2013 to 2023. Methods: This ecological study used data from the Food and Nutritional Surveillance System (SISVAN). The analysis included the prevalences of underweight, overweight, and obesity, stratified by year, sex, and federative unit. Spatial distributions were analyzed using QGIS version 3.22, and temporal trends were assessed with Joinpoint version 4.6 and expressed as annual percentage changes (APCs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: Between 2013 and 2023, SISVAN monitored 10,451,758 children under five years, 30,831,720 adults, and 4,456,650 elderly individuals in the Legal Amazon. Stunting in children under five years decreased from 20.45% to 15.30%, with a significant downward trend (APC: −2.7; 95% CI: −3.7; −1.6). Childhood overweight exhibited a general downward trend but with notable fluctuations. Overweight in adults increased from 48.85% to 64.64%, and obesity from 17.10% to 28.49%, both showing significant upward trends. For the elderly, underweight decreased from 17.47% to 13.04%, with a downward trend until 2018, while overweight increased from 42.35% to 48.22%, with a significant upward trend until 2017. Conclusions: Despite progress in reducing childhood underweight, its prevalence in the Legal Amazon remains high compared to national averages. Significant regional disparities and rising overweight rates among adults and elderly individuals indicate a need for targeted public health strategies to address these nutritional issues. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fact Sheets Malnutrition, (2021); Popkin, Barry Michael, Obesity and the food system transformation in Latin America, Obesity Reviews, 19, 8, pp. 1028-1064, (2018); Malnutrition, (2024); Desnutricao no Brasil E Maior Entre Meninos Negros Aponta Pesquisa; Pesquisa do Ibge Mostra Aumento Da Obesidade Entre Adultos; Carvalho Malta, Deborah Carvalho, The burden of Noncommunicable Diseases in Portuguese Language Countries, Ciencia e Saude Coletiva, 28, 5, pp. 1549-1562, (2023); Rivera-Dommarco, Juan Ángel, Introduction to the double burden of undernutrition and excess weight in Latin America, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 100, 6, pp. 1613-1616, (2014); de Oliveira Meller, Fernanda, Double Burden of Malnutrition and Inequalities in the Nutritional Status of Adults: A Population-Based Study in Brazil, 2019, International Journal of Public Health, 66, (2021); Conde, Wolney Lisbôa, Undernutrition and obesity trends in Brazilian adults from 1975 to 2019 and its associated factors, Cadernos de Saude Publica, 38Suppl 1, Suppl 1, (2022); J Manag Prim Health Care, (2023)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001373358"

Therefore, an increasing number of studies have investigated the EU’s FPs from various angles; however, very few studies address the effect of the complex nature of the concentration of resources and their implementation. While several studies have examined the concentrations of collaboration structures, much less attention has been given to institutions, especially the concentrations that appear during implementation. Institutions that have been awarded several projects at the same time are forced to share their resources between the running projects, which can make the implementation of the projects riskier and thus jeopardize the project’s outcome. Therefore, the role of project management, which must allocate resources among complex implementation structures, such as multiprojects and programs, across portfolios, is appreciated. The aim of this study was to analyze the progression of the nature of concentration, such as institutional concentration in the four most recent framework programs (FPs), namely, FP5, FP6, FP7, and Horizon 2020 (H2020), and the structural and implementation concentrations in the last two framework programs. The study employed the CORDIS database, which encompasses both institutional and project-related information derived from four distinct framework programs. The findings indicated that the parameters of the collaboration network exhibited minimal changes; however, the concentrations of institutions experienced significant alterations. The concentration of complex project structures increased along with institutional concentration, which in turn led to greater efficiency and productivity and, in this way, excellence. Hence, it can be inferred that the output-increasing effect of the program structure is undermined in the deployment of other implementation structures by the need to share resources among several projects running in parallel. The strategy of using parallel projects involves inherent hazards because of the finite nature of resources, which consists primarily of human talent in the form of researchers. The results currently support policy-makers in three ways: (1) an improved understanding of how implementation structures evolve in EU-funded Framework Programs; (2) strengthened linkages among institutional concentration, productivity and excellence; and (3) insights into the design of the EU FP ecosystem. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aagaard, Kaare, The Evolution of a National Research Funding System: Transformative Change Through Layering and Displacement, Minerva, 55, 3, pp. 279-297, (2017); Aagaard, Kaare, Concentration or dispersal of research funding?, Quantitative Science Studies, 1, 1, pp. 117-149, (2020); In European Academy of Management Euram Conference 2023, (2023); Managing High Technology Programs and Projects, (1992); Balland, Pierre Alexandre, Network dynamics in collaborative research in the EU, 2003–2017, European Planning Studies, 27, 9, pp. 1811-1837, (2019); Bloch, Carter Walter, Size, accumulation and performance for research grants: Examining the role of size for centres of excellence, PLOS ONE, 11, 2, (2016); Bloch, Carter Walter, The size of research funding: Trends and implications, Science and Public Policy, 42, 1, pp. 30-43, (2015); Boschma, Ron A., Proximity and innovation: A critical assessment, Regional Studies, 39, 1, pp. 61-74, (2005); In Operations Research Proceedings 2018 Selected Papers of the Annual International Conference of the German Operations Research Society Gor Brussels Belgium, (2019); Breschi, Stefano, Unveiling the texture of a European Research Area: Emergence of oligarchic networks under EU Framework Programmes, pp. 268-298, (2006)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217168577"

Material and Methods: The time series analysis was carried out with secondary data extracted from official databases of the Brazilian Ministry of Health of the external evaluation cycles of the National Program for Improvement of Access and Quality of Primary Health Care (PMAQ-AB). The comparisons of Brazilian regions were performed using Chi-square and Z tests adjusted by the Bonferroni method, and among cycles (years) using the Cochran's Q test (p<0.05). Results: In Brazil, there was an increase in the availability of X-ray equipment between 2014 and 2018 (21.9% vs. 36.3%), and supplies where there was X-ray equipment, which included lead aprons (75.6% vs. 86.4%), dark chamber (darkroom) (86.4% vs. 93.9%) and chemical products for the X-ray film processing (80.7% vs. 86.1%) (p<0.001). The specialized reference in oral radiology was higher in 2018 (71.4%) compared to 2012 (46.8%) and 2014 (66.9%) (p<0.001), with the same trend in the Northeast region (p<0.001). North and Northeast showed growing numbers for most items evaluated, with a reduction in regional inequalities. Conclusion: The availability of equipment, supplies, and specialized reference among Brazilian regions increased. Although regional inequalities persist in Brazil, a reduction was observed in the analyzed period. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aps, Johan K.M., Diagnostic efficacy of and indications for intraoral radiographs in pediatric dentistry: a systematic review, European archives of paediatric dentistry : official journal of the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry, 21, 4, pp. 429-462, (2020); Lira-Junior, Ronaldo, Overview of dental radiology in Brazil: Availability of equipment and ambulatory production of radiographs, Revista Cubana de Estomatologia, 49, 3, pp. 223-231, (2012); Robrac, (2014); Júnior, Gilberto Alfredo Pucca, Ten years of a national oral health policy in Brazil: Innovation, boldness, and numerous challenges, Journal of Dental Research, 94, 10, pp. 1333-1337, (2015); Travassos, Cláudia Mariade Rezende, Geographic and social inequalities in the access to health services in Brazil: 1998 and 2003, Ciencia e Saude Coletiva, 11, 4, pp. 975-986, (2006); Guaju, (2017); Albuquerque, Mariana Vercesi, Regional health inequalities: Changes observed in Brazil from 2000-2016, Ciencia e Saude Coletiva, 22, 4, pp. 1055-1064, (2017); undefined, (2012); undefined, (2015); Rev Pesq Saude, (2014)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005887023"
